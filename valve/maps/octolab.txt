*** Info about the Map

This is a FFA style DM map for Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing 
Force. I actually think the OpFor version is probably a lot more 
fun, as I like the weapon selection from OpFor better. One of my 
friends (ADEUP, thanx a lot buddy!) put the beta of the plain old 
HL version on his server and we had fun with 3 on 3 teamplay too.

If you were wondering, it's called octolab because the layout is 
contained inside an octogon, and because I used the c2a4 lab texture 
set. This is my favorite texture set from HL. I know that lab style 
has been done a lot, but I think the map is different enough from 
most other lab style maps that it will stand out a bit.

Waypoints for the Jumbot are included for playing against bots in 
the HL version of the map. There aren't any bots for OpFor as I 
write this, but as soon as there is one I'll release a waypoint 
file for the OpFor addon.

Weapons in the HL version of the map are:

- Crowbar (start with it)
- Glock (handgun, start with it)
- RPG
- Gauss (Tau cannon)
- Hornet Gun
- Shotgun
- 9mmAR w/grenades (Machine gun)
- Crossbow
- Hand Grenades
- Tripmines
- Satchels
- Snarks

The 357 is left out because it's not very useful anyway, and the 
egon (gluon gun) is left out because i despise it with every 
fiber of my being. The Hornet gun is left in because some people 
just can't live without it. Also, with many heavy weapons (rpg, 
gauss, AR grenades) close by, anyone relying exclusively on the 
hornet gun will not last long.

Weapons in the OpFor version are:
- Pipe Wrench (start with it)
- Glock (start with it)
- Spore Launcher (the green thing that shoots green things)
- Gauss
- Shockroach (shoots the balls of blue energy, requires no ammo)
- Shotgun
- 9mmAR w/grenades
- M249 (chain-fed machine gun)
- Sniper Rifle
- Desert Eagle (handgun with laser sight)
- Barnacle (grappling hook)
- Displacer (the BFG that you can teleport yourself with)
- Hand Grenades
- Tripmines
- Satchels
- Snarks

As you can see, the OpFor version is much more diverse in 
weaponry. The displacer is hidden, along with some medkits and 
batteries. There's a couple other secrets related to computer 
panels, but I'll leave you to find those. ;]

If you do play this map, or put it in your server's rotation, I'd 
love to hear about it. Send me an email at axon@thefortress.org
