Description         : This is my second map, and hopefully people will
                      think it is far better than my first. Some of the
                      more common complaints about Alpha were the
                      simple architecture, the texturing, and some
                      areas having no reason to enter them. I've tried
                      to improve that with Penance, and I have also put
                      a great deal of effort into the connectivity.

                      Hopefully you can have some fun playing this map,
                      as I know I did in the process of making it.
