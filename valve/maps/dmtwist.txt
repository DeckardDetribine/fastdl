This is my first completed brush-tech map ever

******I made this map with all my brightness settings in-game on max,
hence darkness, unless you do the same.  I spent alot of time making
the lighting look soft and natural on THOSE settings.***********

there is one crafty secret in the level. (batteries galore)

I know the skull from Hamlet is yorick.  I'm a different skull
skull altogether :-)

ps thanks to:
