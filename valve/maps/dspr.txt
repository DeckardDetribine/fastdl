description:      This is a new kind of map for me. If you have played concealed then
                  you will understand :). Its completely different from my last map and 
                  in my opinion for the better. 

                  This map plays best with about 4 to 8 people if your looking for an action 
                  packed frag fest. There is a button at the top of the map which allows you 
                  to drain the water at the bottom therefore leaving anyone in the water an easy
                  target. The water stays drained for 30 seconds and the button will reset one minute
                  after the water has returned to its normal height. 

                  I felt that the gauss gun is just too cool to get just any old way so I've set up a
                  trap for you all. Above the small passage way which leads to the gauss gun is a glass 
                  ceiling. This allows the players above the gauss gun to see if anyone dares grab the 
                  gun. In the room with the glass floor is a button which opens the floor of the passage
                  way. the button also drains the water in the small pit. Anyone who is standing in the 
                  passage way at this time is dropped into the pit whilst the doors close up and the 
                  water once again rises, drowning the victim. If you're clever, once you've trapped your
                  foe you will grab the gun yourself and blast through the floor of the pit,
                  getting a free frag. If you don't understand this then try it out yourself because its 
                  damn hard to explain! 

                  (TIP: the doors to the pit stay open for 8 seconds. In the pit there is a button which 
                  removes the glass from the room where the player pushed the button to trap you. This 
                  makes him/her fall into the same pit as you and you can get your revenge with your 
                  trusty crowbar (or any other weapon of choice... as long as it works underwater... :)

                  I also tested this map out for teamplay and it actually was pretty fun. Its not built
                  for teamplay but dominating the trap is fun. try it!

info
                  This map was tested with a P ][ 333, 128mb SDram,
                  Voodoo2 banshee 16mb graphics card in GLmode and with
                  a P200, with 32mbram and in software mode. It ran fine 
                  on both computers. The only problem I could see was that
                  in nonGL mode, when you are standing at the very top of 
                  the map looking down at the water when it has been drained 
                  it seems to 'disappear' in strips.

                  as always I would love some feedback on how this map played, 
                  I would prefer praise but if you really hate it then I suppose 
                  I don't really mind (sniff sniff).
