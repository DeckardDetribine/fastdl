Description:
------------
When i was in Austria, i saw a castle there and thought: wouldnt it be cool to make a
castle map. Here is the product of my mapping efforts in crunchy DM format. Be sure
to play this map with the Arcana Mysteria Magica mod as well for a fun gameplay experience.
Expect lots of vertical gameplay. (-:

Permissions:

You may do pretty much anything you want with this map as long as you abide by 2 rules:

1: You may not sell any part of this map in any form unless you obtain permission from me.
2: I must be listed in the credits of anything that uses any part of this map.

That said, i am pretty cool about people using my work as a base and/or using parts 
of my maps in their maps. If you have reason to want the source files to this map, 
you can contact me explaining your reasons, and the chances are that i will give you 
the source files you requested.
