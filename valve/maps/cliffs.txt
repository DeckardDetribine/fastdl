I like space levels, but I decided to make one on Earth, so to speak.  Thus, here is a HL DM cliff and abyss level that I made in about 2 days.  This map includes a fogging technique that I invented a long time ago but never used until now - it's somewhat of a kludge using func_illusionary's.  This level is good also with 200 gravity.

This includes a few custom textures; these are compiled in the actual BSP file.

This map and other maps of mine are available at http://thehobbit.wox.org/hl-maps/
