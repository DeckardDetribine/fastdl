Description		: Deathmatch map for Halflife. A large level based on some type
			  of water proccessing plant. This is my first publically released
			  map. Although it is large it should be easy to learn as most areas
			  are unique. All weapons are avaliable and there are a couple of
			  interactive features as well. Due to the size of the map I would
			  recommmend a minimum of 6 players. A lot of effort has been put
			  into keeping the r_speeds down and most of the testing was done
			  in software. This map should run well on most systems.
			  
Additional Credits to   :  The DOE @ http://www.lowlife.com/halflife/ for putting up this map for
			   testing. This was very helpfull and I highly recommend this site to 
			   anyone needing to test their map.
			   
			   To Coughcool for running the beta on his server and his input as well as
			   Evichild and Martyr for hours of testing. And to taZer and everyone else 
			   who showed up for testing.
			  
			   The Planethalflife editing forum and everybody there. This map wouldn't
			   be here without their knowledge. And no I'm not blaming them! A special
			   thanks to Hellbringer for his timely response to many of my questions.
			  
                           The HL Editing Resource. Great site!
			 
			   And of course, Valve for the game and Brian Morris for the editor.

Installation:
Unzip the waterwerx.bsp file to your C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\valve\maps directory.
That is the default directory, yours may vary.

Hints!

Got stuck getting the RL, there is a way out. See the switch with the light over it?

You want that egon on the second shelve that comes complete with ammo and armor. I bet
you do! Go upstairs and get that crate. Better keep an eye on it though, while it's a
tough crate, it is breakable. And when it's gone that shelve becomes unreachable. You can
try the guass but I couldn't do it.

Does that long pipe feel too long? Get up on the side of the pipe and away you go! At
least one way.

All railings can be shot through but the walkways and catwalk gratings can not.
