** PLAY INFORMATION **

SINGLE PLAYER:
Just to familiarise yourself.

MULTIPLAYER:
4-8 players. 6 seemed the ideal amount. 16 respawn points are included.

DESCRIPTION:
Small map based *loosely* on a sewage facility theme. I opted for gameplay over realism in the end.

PLAYING:
One press of either of the buttons yields obvious results - bridges are briefly extended to the RPG platform. Another of the more powerful weapons, the Gluon, is located inside a poisonous sewage pipe. The poison lingers for around 5 seconds, so don't try grabbing the Gluon when on low health. Not much to chunder on about here as Jaw Breaker is my smallest map so far.

Playtested with Phineas bots for 5 separate hour long sessions. They don't go for the high-positioned Gauss, Snarks in the sewer pipes, or RPG (though DO activate the RPG bridges), though generally play pretty well and don't get stuck anywhere. Feel free to create a Jumbot jrf file.

Hope you like Jaw Breaker. I'd appreciate feedback too...to my email address at the top of this text file. It's a major commitment putting in the time to design these damn maps, so I fully welcome any & all constructive encouragement / ideas / criticisms / praises.



** WHAT'S NEXT **

"Corps68". TFC CTF. 4mb bsp size with an atmosphere similar to that in C4/TNT. 99% complete (should be released over the next week or two).

"Nostromo". TFC CTF which has a massive bsp size of 5.7mb, and is the sequel to my previous TFC map Orbital. 99% complete (should be released over the next week or two).

After that, I'll be making a few more DM maps similar in size to Jaw Breaker, and maybe venturing into Quake 3 Arena mapping a little.



** INSTRUCTIONS **

And of course keep this text file. 8¬)



** CONSTRUCTION **

Base                    : Created from scratch. A small section of the upper tier (opposite the RPG) was *influenced* (as opposed to directly copied brush for brush) by a Quake 3 Arena map, q3dm3, and was created by myself from scratch. Obviously full credit for the idea to id software's map designers.
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft v2.1
Custom textures		: Yes, a few grass textures found on a bargain-basement texture CD. The text file mentioned all are free for public use, so that no doubt means you can lock me up now, nice Mr.Policeman.
Custom sounds		: No.
Known Bugs              : Just that I've stretched some textures, so decals may be out-of-shape/size. For info, all light fixtures are func_illusionary's - don't be surprised by being able to jump through light fixtures.
Build Time              : 2 weeks, on & off. Estimate of 10 hours creating (on work lunch hours) & 5 hours playtesting (at home). I've also been working other maps simultaneously.
Compile Time		: Around 5 minutes on my PII 300mhz w/224mb. (Full vis, extra rad).
