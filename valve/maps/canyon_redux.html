<dt>Players:</dt>
  <dd>2-10</dd>
<dt>Known Bugs:</dt>
  <dd>None.  Having said that, however, there are several things which don't work entirely as they should under <i>standard</i> Half-Life:
    <ul>
      <li>The two rolling doors which actually open do not reverse direction when they close.  Despite certain attributes in the Hammer FGD file which suggest otherwise, it does not seem to be supported by the HL engine.  I fixed this (via the SDK code) in my HLDM mini-mod; watch my <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/coding/">Coding</a> page for details of this tweak, they'll be published there shortly.</li>
      <li>A couple of spoken sentences which should be heard, aren't.  They're not critical, although they do change the way you approach certain parts of the level.  If you're really keen you can add the following lines to your <code>sound/sentences.txt</code> file:
      <ul>
      <li>CR_UED user entry detected</li>
      <li>CR_WDNW buzwarn buzwarn warning, unauthorized weapon detected in north west sector</li>
      <li>CR_WDSE buzwarn buzwarn warning, unauthorized weapon detected in south east sector</li>
      </ul>
      The "weapon detected" warnings are triggered by the white sensor fields at each end of the level.</li>
      <li>The haze which you might see in one of the screenshots is generated by an env_fog entity which is part of my own HLDM mod (but again, see my <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/coding/">Coding</a> page for details!)  Standard HLDM simply ignores the presence of the entity.</li>
      <li>Please <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/contact_pete.php?subj=Canyon_Redux_bugs">let me know</a> if you find anything more!</li>
      </ul>
    If I receive enough (ie, <i>any</i>) requests, I'll make my <code>petesdm</code> mod available -- but apart from the minor details listed above, this level should run fine without it.

<h2>Canyon</h2>

<p>A long time ago, in a cubicle close to my own -- spurred on by my own <span class="level">LavaLab</span> and <span class="level">LavaLab: Erupt</span> -- my friend Ben Davies decided to make an HLDM level of his own.  Thus was <b>Canyon</b> -- notable chiefly for its entirely un-canyon-like attributes -- born.</p>

<p>Over the years, as we played <b>Canyon</b>, and as I churned out my four <span class="level">Lab17</span> levels, Ben spotted more and more things which, if he had the time, he would like to &quot;fix&quot; in his level.  However, he soon discovered that he had misplaced the source file required to make the desired changes.  Early attempts at decompiling his <code>canyon.bsp</code> were not particularly successful, and he abandoned the idea.</p>

<p>Time passed.</p>

<p>I built (and we played) <span class="level">Necropolis: Mausoleum</span>.  After a couple of false starts on my next possible project -- one of which, in fact, was a <i>reimagining</i> of the <b>Canyon</b> concept, set on (and in) an asteroid in deep space -- I decided instead to remake my first level, driven by its perceived flaws, and I spent the next eighteen months working on <span class="level">Lab11: LavaLab</span>.  When it was finally released it was, I have to say, visually stunning (for an HLDM level, anyway!)  I proceeded to enhance the visual polish of the level by getting fog working in my DM mod and adding a wicked-looking heat haze to <span class="level">Lab11</span>.  And in the weeks preceding the release of the finished product, we started playing <b>Canyon</b> again.  Needless to say, Ben started speaking, once more, about fixing it up.</p>

<p>I downloaded a couple of level decompilers and managed to get a <code>canyon.map</code> file which, with minimal work, would be useable.  I offered it to Ben so he could jump in and fix what he wanted to fix, and when he hesitated -- strong with the force, is Ben, but many are the demands on his time -- I tossed out an alternative: I would fix it for him.</p>

<p>He agreed.</p>

<h2>Canyon: Redux</h2>

<p>I quickly realised that the only way I could properly tackle the project was if I rebuilt it from scratch.  I took a few measurements from the retrieved <code>map</code> file, then promptly tossed it away and commenced my own level.  Using the measurements as a rough guide -- and with a texture set I've wanted to use for some time driving any variations to the size of the level -- I proceeded to build a rough duplication of Ben's <b>Canyon</b> layout; doors, rooms, platforms, all roughly in the same place.  It <i>is</i> essentially the same level, only the details are changed.</p>

<p>Since I already had a predetermined layout to follow, I didn't have to spend any time thinking about gameplay; all I had to do was build.  As a consequence, this level -- despite being one of the most complicated I've ever built (even more so than <span class="level">Lab11: LavaLab</span>) and despite the problems I ran into along the way -- has been finished far quicker than any other level I've built.  Even the original <span class="level">LavaLab</span> took a little longer than this did!</p>

<p>I just went over the top with it!  I have learned a lot about what is possible under the HLDM engine since the good ol' days, and I have long since abandoned the rather archaic ideal of limiting <em>r_speeds</em> (on the possibly mistaken belief that most machines these days should be able to happily run any level that the HLDM engine can handle.)  Unconstrained by such petty concerns, focussed only on building the &quot;prettiest&quot; possible upgrade of <b>Canyon</b>, I flung caution to the winds, took the bit between my teeth, and did my worst.  And, yeah, my best!  As a consequence, <em>r_speeds</em> do tend to max out in places at around 7000 -- and I really don't care!</p>

<p>Of course, I <i>do</i> tend to think it's time I switched to another engine; I think I've pushed HLDM as far as I can! :-)</p>

<p>For an alternate view of how this level came to be -- for anybody who has actually made it this far and is still interested -- check out my <a href="http://pete-jones.livejournal.com/35555.html">LiveJournal Post</a> on the subject.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Usual story.  It's DeathMatch: just kill anything with a pulse, and have fun!</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>It's a long way to the bottom ... watch your step!  Of course, long before you reach the debris at the bottom of this garbage disposal facility, you will be vaporised by the energy field...</p>

<p>This level has all the standard HLDM weapons available -- and is one of my few levels to include the Gauss Cannon (aka the &quot;Jump Gun&quot;!) although its usefulness in that capacity is limited.</p>

<p>I'm particularly happy with the recharge booth design, and how they affect gameplay...</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>I would appreciate feedback from anybody who likes (or dislikes) this level.  If you have something to say about this level, or an error to report, please <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/contact_pete.php?subj=Canyon_Redux">contact me</a>.  Without feedback, how can I hope to improve?  :-)</p>

<h2>Playtesting</h2>

<p>This level has been extensively playtested by myself and Ben, and several redesigns came out of our experiences therein.</p>

<h3>Revision History</h3>

<h4>Version 1.0 -- April 13, 2009</h4>

<p>I am releasing this after extensive testing and numerous recompiles.  It is, I believe, as good as it's going to get!  (I do have a couple of additional ideas I want to include, but they will need to be implemented in my PetesDM mod first...)</p>

<h2><a name="credits"></a>Other Credits</h2>

<p>Thanks go to the following:</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li><a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve Software</a>, for producing this great game, and giving us the means of creating our own levels.</li>
<li>Ben Davies, who is very much the co-designer of this level -- even more so than usual!  His input along the way has helped me to improve the design enormously!</li>
<li>I made extensive use of third party textures (all of which I found on <a href="http://wadfather.planethalflife.gamespy.com/new/">The Wadfather</a>.)  A (hopefully) complete list follows:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.simonoc.com/">Sock</a>, the person who created the Egyptian texture set that I used throughout my <span class="level">Necropolis: Mausoleum</span> level, also created the sister set of textures called &quot;Techno&quot; that formed the basis of the &quot;Canyon&quot; itself, the inner exterior.
    <ul>
        <li>I have actually wanted to use this Techno set ever since I first found it while looking for Egyptian textures -- and, in fact, the first time I attempted to use them in a level, it was to be my <em>re-imagining</em> of Ben's <b>Canyon</b>.  That level never saw the light of day -- it may yet; it <em>was</em> substantially different from this one -- so it seemed appropriate to use the Techno textures here!</li>
        <li>(<em>The only drawback with the Techno textures, IMHO, is that they are great for exteriors but not as useful for interiors.  I'd already learned that the first time I tried to use them so this time I was already prepared to look for alternatives -- that had to also look reasonably consistent with Techno...</em>)</li></ul></li>
    <li>The graffiti in the level (&quot;Welcome to the CANYON Have a nice day&quot; &amp; &quot;BGD &amp; PRJ&quot; -- the latter being the initials of the two people responsible for the level) I created myself (on top of one of Sock's Techno textures!) and while texture editing is not my strong suit, I'm pretty happy with how they turned out!</li>
    <li>Most of the textures used for the <em>outer interior</em> (you think <em>you're</em> confused?!) are from <a href="http://ikq.planetquake.gamespy.com/">Iikka 'Fingers' Ker&auml;nen</a>'s &quot;IK Base&quot; collection.</li>
    <li>The warehouse room -- yeah, <em>more</em> crates -- is primarily textured with <a href="http://speedy.planetquake.gamespy.com/">Speedy</a>'s &quot;SpeedTech&quot; texture set, although a couple of his textures <em>were</em> used elsewhere.</li>
    <li>The crates themselves -- the few textures I could afford to squeeze in by this stage in the level's creation -- were mostly from the &quot;MapCenter Texture Challenge 1: Crates&quot; collection:
        <ul>
        <li>The Titan Shipping Container by <a href="mailto:bushboy@ritualistic.com">Matthew &quot;bushboy&quot; Trow</a>.</li>
        <li>The red and blue metal crates by <a href="http://www.karloff.unvoll.com">Karloff</a>.</li>
        <li>The large grungy crates by <a href="mailto:raygunn@gamedesign.net">Jesse &quot;raYGunn&quot; McCree</a>.</li>
        <li>The large rusty/shiny crates by <a href="mailto:techx@digitalarenas.com">TechX</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>I used a few textures (most notably the floor-level corridor lights) from <a href="http://www.evillair.net/v2/">Evillair</a>'s &quot;Texture Pack 4&quot; and &quot;Texture Pack 6&quot; -- and I've added his texture sets to my list for potential future use, because the few of his I used barely scratched the surface...</li>
    <li>The rain texture used to make the water dripping from the pipes (not to mention the tutorial which showed me how to do it) was courtesy of TWHL's <a href="http://www.twhl.co.za/user.php?id=57">Seventh Monkey</a>!</li>
    <li>The environment map (ie, the 'sky' graphics) I've used is &quot;Fallhaven&quot; by <a href="http://lance.phlinux.com/">Lance S. Winkel</a>.  The first time I saw it, several years ago, I thought it would be ideal for Ben's <b>Canyon</b>; it only seemed fair that I use it for mine!  The environment map was downloaded from <a href="http://wadfather.planethalflife.gamespy.com/new/">The Wadfather</a>.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>If I have missed anyone, <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/contact_pete.php?subj=Canyon_Redux">let me know</a> and I'll add you to the list! :-)</li>
