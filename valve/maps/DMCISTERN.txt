MAP INFO:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Cistern of Death

BSP-Filename: DMCistern

Player: 2-7

Description: "Cistern of Death" is a labyrinth with some different ways,
             which have 2 or rather 3 floors. There are 3 ways to come to
             the highest floor, the floor in the middle can be reached from
             almost everywhere, exactly the same is with the downest floor
             which is just flooded with water. On the map there´s one secret-
             area, the secret is relative easy to find, but very difficult
             to reach (, I suggest the "rocket-jump" with the Nukeweapon)!
             With 3 and more players, life will come to the map. With 5 and
             more players it will be a little, funny massacre!
             So have a good killing !!!

Special Info: With "Cistern of Death" I tried to built a Deathmatch-Map like
              those, which are included in QuakeI. I think, that most of the
              Half-Life-Map´s are realy good Single-Player-Map´s, but not so
              good for typical Deatchmatches. However, my new map is builded
              like an old Cistern which is, how I think very usable to give 
              a good place for hard Deatchmatches!

              -I don´t know anything about the speed of my level in the 
              -internet, but in LAN-Games is the level fast enough for
              -good playing (, on slow machines like mine, too).
