(*)
"Tokamak" is the name of some kind of fusion-reactor of Princeton University in New Jersey.
During a controlled nuclear fusion in 1993, they produced temperatures equivalent to the core- 
temperature of the sun. 
I didn't intend to rebuild THIS facility (as you can see). It's just supposed to be a hidden 
base in the black mesa. (somehow like that...)

*** CONSTRUCTION ***

I used "gasworks" as concept for my map (simple outdoor area with access to a base below).
The reactor was part of an older map I built (It isn't complete), I just imported and connected it.

Detail:
First I wanted to place a lot more guard-towers and other detailed stuff. But when I 
finished the map and started to optimize for speed I had to delete all the detailed objects.

Weapon placement 1.:
As I wanted to keep the map realistic I started with arranging weapons realistically. 
That is: Not placing an RPG on a roof or some guns and ammunition on the floor of a big room 
BUT: Damn, you can't waste all the good spots. (there were just not enough weapons in the map). 

Weapon placemnt 2.:
No gluon, No hornet ???
Yes, I don't like them.

Testing:
I had no chance to see how the level works in multiplayer, so PLEASE be lenient towards me.


Known Bugs          	: - some texturing might not be exact (ladders)
			  - no way out if you fall into the elevator shaft
			  - must be the game: the doorsound is screwed up in multiplayer 
			  - must be the game: you can jump longer in singleplayer than in multiplayer
			    (try to jump from the building with the elevator to the 1st container
			    it works in singleplayer ,though it's hard)
			  - take a look at the "B" at the switch.(What's wrong?)  ;)

*** FURTHER PROJECTS *** 

This is my first level I made for Halflife and probably my last one, too.
Because it takes a lot of time I think i'll quit making levels for any 3D-shootin game.
But, it's just passion and maybe when there's nothing else to do, when the weather is bad 
and I feel this extraordinary desire for creative actitvity I'll build another tiny little level 
(more Deathmatch orientated), but that will be the last one for shure.
