LEVEL DESCRIPTION
=================
This is a pretty standard DM map centered around a nuclear waste facility
situated on a mountaintop. The twist is lots of moving parts, lasers, glowing
goo, and machinery. I paid special attention to game flow 
and keeping r_speeds to reasonable levels, so let me know what you think!

KNOWN BUGS
==========
May be slightly unstable due to a large number of env_shooters. 
I have encountered the edict limit on one occasion to date.

There is an odd bug in the main goo-pool.
