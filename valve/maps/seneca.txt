Map Description         : A very quake3/ut style space arena for HLDM. While maps like this are very
			  common for the two prior mentioned games, for Half-Life they are quite rare,
			  and even more rare to be found well made. I was in the mood for making a
			  quick arena and this is the result.

			  Beware, r_speeds are VERY high in this map. Due to being very open, and
			  quite complex in terms of architecture, there was very little I could do to
			  lower them. I am confident I have done everything in my ability to get them
			  as low as I can, but they still peak at 1800 odd. Despite this, the map
			  seems to run just as well as many lower r_speed maps, and in some cases
			  even better. I guess it goes to show that r_speeds aren't the only pointer
			  to how well a map will run :)

			  While the map is designed to work in HLDM just fine, it is probably best
			  suited to the Adrenaline Gamer mod's arena mode...

Misc Author Info        : This is my ninth unique map release. I am an 18 year old currently studying
			  BSc Computer Games Technology at the University of Abertay in Dundee,
			  Scotland. Fingers crossed after getting this degree I will become a
			  fully fledged Level Designer working in the industry :) Outside of level
			  design I am a skateboarder, rollerblader, ice skater and snowboarder.
			  I listen to ska/punk/emo music and play a helluva lot of computer games! I
			  am also a member of a small student games development team based in Dundee.
