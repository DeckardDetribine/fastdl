Installation
------------

Unzip the file apo13now!.bsp into your ...\sierra\halflife\valve\maps directory



Just a few tips...
------------------

(1) When going for the RPG there are two ways to pick up the gun without being killed 
    by the slime surrounding it. The first one is very simple: Just be sure to have full
    health and some armor on and then run through the slime as quickly as you can. The 
    second one: First go for the long jump module. Using this module you can get from the
    platform with the RPG on it to the ladder without getting nearly any damage.
(2) The hornetgun is a pretty effective weapon in this map. But be aware of snipers when 
    picking it up!
(3) refers to (2): Try to kill those bastards going for the hornetgun with the crossbow. 
    A good sniping position may be on the sniper roof on the opposite side of the valley.
(4) Although the gauss was weakened in the latest HL version it's still a pretty effective
    weapon and furthermore it's pretty easy to get.... so....
(5) Keep your ears open! Oftenly sounds (footsteps) tell you where your opponents are...



What's new in this 2nd release?
---------------------------------------
- a lot of minor gameplay improvements (improved places where you could get hung easily, etc.)
- added some more corridors in order to improve connectivity
- the Gauss gun can now be found in another room (nearby the old location)
- some very minor lighting changes
- fixed a small texture error 
- changed text displayed when hitting this one specific button (whoohoo!!)
- added 2 PlanetHalfLife logos 
- updated readme-files
