---Notes---
This is my second map. As you will see, the tau is a little tricky to reach ;0)
And if you get trapped while you reach the rpg, i hope you have the lj module although it's still possible to get out.

E-mail me with any comments on the level, praise or criticism.
Any feedback is much appreciated.


---Special thanks---
I'd like to thank in advance the reviewers who have the patience to testing all these levels.
