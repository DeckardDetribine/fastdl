I've taken over this map since Orpheus decided to quit HL.  As this map 
has basically been abandoned by everyone, me included, I have decided to 
make the changes I deem necessary and attempt to compile and finish this map.

If you object to my changes, I still have Orpheus's last compile and can 
revert back if need be.  I will be keeping various betas and will make a 
detailed changelog so you can see what I've done for each section.  

Any and all comments are welcome.  I can easily change things now that I can 
compile it, but be reasonable as many of the map limits are close to maxed 
out (especially clipnodes).  Tell me something like redo a section and I'll 
tell you to go to hell.



MAX_MAP_MIPTEX:		overcome in beta 1 by adding -texdata memory
MAX_MAP_PLANES:  	overcome in beta 1 by using XP_Cagey's tools
MAX_MAP_CLIPNODES:  	overcome in beta 2 by clipping off many sections
MAX_MAP_MODELS:  	overcome in beta 3 by entity optimization  
MAX_MAP_FACES:  	overcome in beta 4 by fixing a leak
MAX_PATCHES:		overcome in beta 4 by using HLRAD with -sparse command
MAX_MAP_LIGHTING:	overcome in beta 4 by adding -lightdata memory

CHANGELOG

BETA 5
-a_s- removed yellow lights in main room.  this is a test to see how the lighting looks and is in no way permanent
-yak- fixed a brush through floor error in main room
-yak- deleted some lights in first main room cause they sucked
-yak- deleted some lights in rock room as it's just too bright in there
-grim- fixed a pitch black air duct area, dunno how that one happened
-grim- there were six light entities where there should have been two
-dietz- clipped off a few more areas
-dietz- went a little overboard with null textures causing a noticeable HOM.  now fixed
-dietz- deleted a pointless func_illusionary that for some reason could be seen in the sky from Grimlock's area
-dietz- slowed down fan a little bit to closer match sound
-dietz- deleted a light and corner detail because it caused a nasty clipping error ingame


-all- reduced light_env intensity by 60%, we shall see how this looks

BETA 4

I had two issues, a max_map_faces error and a leak.  I started first by retexturing as 
much as I could with the null texture.  If it turned out that it couldn't fix the error,
it would still reduce r_speeds a little bit.  Turns out that I had a leak in A_S's section
caused by me chopping up the ceiling in the outdoor hallways to fit an angled light in there.
There was no void showing, but I guess it was one of those tiny gaps between angled brushes.
I just added null textured brushes over the top of the section and fixed the problem.




BETA 3 -this is going to be purely an entity optimization beta unless I come across anything else (at least 24 brush entities need to go)
