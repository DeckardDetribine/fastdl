---------Description------------------------------------------------
Yutani2 is a revised version of Yutani.  This version has much better r_speeds and lower polygon counts, making internet play smoother.  The wpoly count peaks at 700 in one or two places, but wpolys are below 500 everywhere else, and often much lower.  There are also some texture changes and a cool Power Loader which I made from studying pictures of the loader used in the Alien movies.

This map depicts part of an installation owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the infamous "Company" from the Aliens series of movies. Almost all of the textures used were converted from the "Alien vs Predator" game by Fox and Rebellion, using a great texture utility program called Wally.  They are embedded in the bsp file using the -wadinclude parameter of Zoners tools, so no additional wad file is needed. It does make the filesize larger though.

I am a big Aliens fan, and my maps tend to reflect this. I get bored with the same old "military camp" type maps, so I try to make maps that are more interesting.  This map was designed specifically with Oz in mind.  Oz is a mod for half-life, featuring a grapple hook among other things.  While I tried to make the map playable in regular Half-Life, most areas are open with high ceilings to better accomodate the hook in Oz.  The layout is relatively simple, and while there is a lot of square footage, all halls lead back to the central battle area to keep players together.  Might get a little laggy with lots of people, depends on the server and connection speeds of players.  Geared towards high speed connections and good video cards.

The Power Loader I made has lots of little brushes, and therefore increases the polygon count significantly.  However, I made sure to block it off well from the rest of the map so it does not affect players in the main battle areas.  It just looks too cool to leave out :)

Any good mapmaker knows there must be a balance between playability and detail, and this is often the hardest part of mapping.  I tried my best to strike this balance.  Any and all feedback is welcome.  Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the map!
