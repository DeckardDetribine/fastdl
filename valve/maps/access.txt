Description		: A military base in the mountains with access tunnels running 		              	          throughout and an underground "sewer". I got tired of working on this                            level and rushed to finish it. Don't get me wrong - it is better built                           than most any map out there and all the textures line up perfectly.                              It's a good map. I just got lazy :) I realize there are some things                              that could've made this map better (i.e. ambient sounds) but, as I                               said, I rushed to finish it. Besides that, my knowledge of half-life                             and worldcraft is limited.
