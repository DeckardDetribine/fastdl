Stuff                   :

Single Player           : If you want to look around.
Deathmatch              : Yes (2-6 players) - 8 may be a bit much. 4 is best. 

Construction 

It came from...         : New level from scratch
Editor used             : WorldCraft 2.0 beta.
Known errors            : I have got stuck under the stairs, where the trip-mines are.
                          But this should not happen again. I hope.

Build Time              : About 10-12 hours construction. 1-2 hours object placement and getting 
                          the nerve gas trap to work. 2 hours sound and 'tweaking' the trap.
                          many a day playing. 
                          Full compile: VIS 248 sec. QRAD 668 sec. Total 1032 sec (18 min.)
			  
Getting it going        :
                          If you are reading this you probably have already unzipped all the stuff
                          you need. If you haven't and are using your telepathy to read this file,
                          you should open this zip with Pkunzip running in dos mode. Or if you 
                          must you can disgrace you proud heritage by using WINDOWS and its 
                          associated unzipper to, no doubt, screw up your computer.
                          
                          eg: Pkunzip c:\where\i\put\my\zips\Genocide.zip c:\very\temporary\files

                          where you put it is your business, but if you want the file to work and
                          not waste precious space, I suggest you put Genocide.bsp in 
                          C:\Sierra\Half-life\valve\maps (if Half-life is somewhere else on your
                          HD make sure Genocide.bsp goes in the Valve\Maps sub-directory of 
                          Half-life)
                          
                          Once that is done, the level should work (hurrah!) And you will be able
                          murder all you friends in horribly gruesome ways.

                          If you want to look about the level first (Good idea) Then run Half-life
                          with the -Console command (HL.exe -console). Now at the menu you will have
                          a button marked 'Console.' try pressing it. once at the console, type:
                          
                          deathmatch 1
                          Map Genocide                          

                          This will let you test the level.

A few thoughts          : The settings I use, and you should too.


                          Weapons stay: 2-3 people, OFF. More, ON.

                          Teamplay: if you have 4 or more players.

                          Force Respawn: NO. - Make sure.

                          Time limit: Above 30min please.
                          

                          My aim for this level:
                          A level that runs WELL on my non MMX Cyrix.

                          A 2-6 player level with a trap to send everyone running.
   
                          A level I could use on a LAN. (2 player only)

                          A level that is easy to navigate. Using different lighting to distinguish 
                          the various floors. Also on that is mirrored down the middle for easy
                          remembering of how to get from one place to another.
 
                          Some of the levels I have downloaded have been horrible to get around,
                          trying to get where you want to go, easily and quickly is very important
                          to me. Though the design is made so that you can't simply 'jump' from
                          floor to floor.
 
                          As far as the detail thing goes, this is my first Map. I am making other 
                          DM and SP levels that will be of a higher detail level and have a few
                          hopefully unseen (and very deadly) traps. These DM levels will have a 
                          TeamPlay focus. And some will be set outdoors for better visuals 
                          and larger killing areas.


                          Number of weapons: All but .357. Sorry.
