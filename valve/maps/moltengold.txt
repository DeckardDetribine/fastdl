"Molten Gold": HL deathmatch by [Kasperg] YUGO     2006


Extract the bsp file  into your valve/maps folder

This map takes place in a pseudo-egyptian temple which is somehow bleeding gold. The ancients
could not explain this strange phenomenon, and neither can the mapper!
The map is based on the "Sandscroll" singleplayer maps, although some textures have been
improved for the ocassion. Vertical gameplay is very present in this map, and the layout
allows a good gameflow. However, not everything is OK in this map. Some things got out of 
hand and there's a place in which r_speeds reach unspeakable numbers. Well, it's 2006, so your
computers shouldn't have any problems, I hope!
