Welcome to the abandoned part of Black Mesa, that was turned into the military storage.
The entry to the storage is blocked in cause of broken elevator, that ccan be controlled or
repaired only at the basement level, far underground. So you have to wait for someons help 
and stay alive. There is a real hell eround. there's a war between soldiers, aliens and 
survivors like Gordon Freeman, Barney Colhoun and others.
There also still water collectors system. It will help you to save your life for some time.
You can use all weapons on your way.
Good luck, mister.
