Hell-Class: HLDM 'arena' level by Leperous (http://www.snarkpit.com)
Released: 13/10/2002

This level was meant to be created for the SnarkPit contrasting arena, although
if you play it you may notice the contrast is a bit lame really, as is the rest of 
the level. But I'm happy with the result, only 4 days of mapping and it's perfectly
playable. Might turn into an NS or proper DM level one day...
