Description		: Fight each other on the top of a dam,
                          below it, inside it.  Wreak havoc in
                          the turbine room and firebomb the
                          control room.

                          Plenty of snipe points.. bunch of
                          shadows.. and no real dead ends..
                          What else can I say?  It's a dam.

		::: ADDITIONAL INFO :::
================================================================
R_speeds average to 400-450 for most areas, few areas/positions
hit a peak of approximately 700 or so.  Clients at 300MHz or
higher with 3D accel. should have no problems.  Servers with
8 players (including the client on the server) seem to be fine
on systems 350MHz or higher.
