* Author/Map Information *

I am currently working on two bachelor's degrees. One of which is Business Management, the other being Psychology at the
University of Missouri.

If you like what you see, and have an *interesting job offer*(full time, paid, relocation, etc) pass it along. I am not actively
seeking a position anywhere, but I will certainly entertain any offers.

This map was designed while working on a "yet to be announced project". I needed a brief break from that project, so I chose
to do a different genre on my current favorite game, Half-Life.

The scene of this map is an alien planet. The base is built up from a ruined station(hence the older, rusty textures in the middle and bottom).

As far as R_Speeds are concerned, the from beta to final I lowered them quite a bit in a few areas. Unfortunately, I was
forced to remove some really cool details(i would rather cut detail, than good gameplay). Parts of the map hit around
560 or so, but nothing a decent PC of todays standards can't handle. The project I am currently working on has poly counts
around 800 -1200 w/o curves so it was a challenge to get below 600 with this map;-). 

For those of you who haven't downloaded Worldcraft 3.3 what are you waiting for? The new opengl renderer is handy. I've used
all sorts of editors in the past(stoneless, qoole, qeradiant, older worldcrafts, etc) and this is my favorite half-life editor now.

Enjoy!
