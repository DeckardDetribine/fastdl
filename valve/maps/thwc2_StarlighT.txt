I created this map for the TheWall Remake Contest of Original HLDM Maps

It`s my futuristic interpretation of the old Lambda_Bunker.

The focus was on getting the map`s beauty boosted a lot , because the Gameplay had to be the same.

I hope i did my job well , and u like it.

Hope u have that much fun playing the map , that i had , creating it :)

Nuttin` left to say , HF & Enjoy!
