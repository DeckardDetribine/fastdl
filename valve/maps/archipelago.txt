Story:			The Xenians have been driven out of an important sector of the
			Borderworld wilderness. The route is now clear for advance into the
			industrial areas of their domain, and the valuable scientific stuff
			awaiting within. It is time to enter the wilderness sector, but you will
			not be alone. Rival corporations ready their own operatives for
			teleportation to Xen. Once there it will be the usual desperate fight for
			control of pathways and resources. As usual, supplies and munitions have
			been pre-teleported into the area. And you will have to find them, as the
			still imprecise science of teleportation will have scattered them over a
			wide area.
			One more thing: advance drones report that the retreating Xenians left
			some kind of warp-core device in the area, believed to be a weapon of
			mass destruction. The device is primed, but was never activated in time.
			Use at your own discretion.

Intro/description:	There aren't many Xen themed Half-Life DM maps around, but my hope is
			that Archipelago will be accepted as one of the best. I have not skimped
			on the eye-candy. In a way that was my main aim. I like mapping for Xen,
			but did not want to be committed to a whole single-player episode (if its
			not going to be crap, that just takes too long).
			But I think that I know enough of the concepts of DM to make a map that
			plays well (I'm pretty satisfied with how it looks :) .
			This map has lots of interactive stuff in it. You are advised to read the
			'tips/play information' section of this readme, and maybe explore the map
			offline a bit.

Installation:		Place map "archipelago.bsp" in your Half-Life\valve\maps folder. Place
			resource file "archipelago.res" in same folder as "archipelago.bsp" (this
			is just for those who want to host a game with the map, I guess). Place
			the folder "gibfnt" in your Half-Life\valve\sound folder, (you may have
			to create any of these folders, but its unlikely). Run the map any way
			you like, but you will need to be in DM mode ('deathmatch' cvar set to >
			0) if you want to start with longjump module, hornetgun etc.

Tips/play information:	-Before long, you will probably discover the portal, which takes you to
			the island with the 'warp-core'. Shoot the big yellow crystal, and wait
			for bad things to start happening. The first warning is a brief flash.
			Those who know the map will probably pick it up as the early cue to shift
			ass. The second warning comes 20 seconds later and should appeal to most
			peoples sense of urgency. The only good place to be about 50 seconds
			after that will be on the blue healing pad on the island with the doom
			device. Expect a bit of competition for a place on that healing pad
			because there ain't that much room on it :) .

			-In DM mode, you will find yourself equipped with different things to the
			usual, boring pistol/crowbar combo. You still have the crowbar of course,
			but if you run out of ammo you should not have to resort to it. That's
			because on this map, everyone starts with a free hornetgun. I made it
			like this because I love that weapon, it fits the Xen theme well, and
			it helps balance out a map where its possible to accumulate lots of
			powerful weapons quite quickly.
			Also, you start with a free long-jump module, because it is essential
			to utilise lots of high-speed long distance jumping, to get the most out
			of this map.

			-Make the most of the long-jump module and low gravity on this map. Use
			long jumps to fly around the map very quickly. Unfortunately lag is the
			enemy of fun stuff like this. If there is no choice, you can still use
			the 'lo-lag' routes around the map. Ladders (try climbing any of the
			chimney-spires) replace jump pads, and stepped short jumps replace long
			jumps.

			-'The tube' is the red-lit tunnel burrowing under the main part of the
			map. At first there is no obvious way of getting back up to the 'funnel'
			entrance. But you should find there is a mysterious wind blowing you up
			if you just try to run up the tunnel, Matrix style.

			-In the cave with the large healing pool, it's possible to long jump
			straight up to the tunnel above. You can also go up a narrow sloping
			ledge on the wall.

			-This map has a rather complex system that allows you (providing you are
			hosting the game, that is) to decide what happens when players fall in
			the void. Please read about it in the next section of this readme.

Info for server admin/host:
			-There are a number of high drops on this map. It's probably best if the
			falling damage in DM is not set to realistic (ie: left at its default
			setting).

			-Low ping server physics are going to come in handy on this map, if
			you're running an internet game. So leave them enabled (default).

			-I am aware that falling into voids and dying causes chronic annoyance to
 			some people. That is why there is an alternative option in this map.
			Instead of exploding in a thousand giblets when you fall off, you are
			teleported back to solid ground. This may be embarrassing (I hope) but at
			least you will not lose a frag. This 'teleport mode' has to be activated,
 			as 'death mode' is the default. I wanted whoever was running/in charge of
			the server to be the only one who could change 'teleport' or 'death'
			mode. This was done by exploiting how they would be the only ones
			capable of 'cheating'.
			Somewhere in the map there is a secret area, accessible only by
			noclipping *. Finding it is itself quite a fun exercise. First go to the
			area of the map with the 'funnel', the upper entrance to the red-lit
			tube. There is an spiky island with a teleporter. Go to this island and
			carefully look around edge for a small spike pointing across the void.
			Noclip in the direction this spike is 'pointing'. Eventually you should
			see a tiny island with a yellow crystal. Land on the island, and
			shoot/crowbar the crystal. You should get a message saying what will now
			happen if you fall in the void.
			Unfortunately cheats are quite restricted in DM mode. 'Impulse 101' works
			(giving you all weapons), but as far as I know you cannot use the normal
			'noclip' command, even when you are the host and have set 'sv_cheats' to
			'1'. You have to use the Admin Mod thingy (http://www.adminmod.org) which
			provides alternative equivalents of this cheat (and also 'god'). You may
			be familiar with running a server, Admin Mod etc. Most of the Internet
			servers seem to use it nowadays. But you might find it damned impossible,
			just want to host a quick LAN game, or you may not have permission to use
			cheats, whatever. The point is there is an alternative if you want to
			change what happens when you fall off, and you do not have the option of
			noclipping in DM.
			The alternative is just to use a different map, in which the default mode
			is teleport instead of death. But surely, if you are using a modified
			map, everyone who wants to join	your game will need the modified map as
			well. Apparently not. As long as the maps are named the same, the minor
			differences will not matter because the host's map (yours) decides how
			certain things are in the map without consulting the clients (at this
			stage, it has not been tested online for real, so in fact it possibly may
			not work :( ). Obviously you will not be able to keep both versions of
			the map in the same folder all the time, because they have the same name.
			You would just keep the one you want to use in your Half-Life\valve\maps
			folder, and the other one somewhere else (or temporarily rename the one
			you are not using).

			The file archipelago10_televoid.zip can be gotten from
		http://www.mrman58.freeserve.co.uk/spawningtank/files/archipelago10_televoid.zip.
			It is pretty much identical to the .zip archive this readme came from,
			except it contains the modified map (still called archipelago.bsp). Make
			sure you don't accidentally confuse or overwrite one map with another, if
			you get both of them.

			For nothing more than reference, to myself as much as anyone else, I have
			included instructions about how to hax0r archipelago.bsp (death void
			version). It's not too hard. First get yourself a decent hex editor.
			There are loads of good, free ones such as Hex-editor XVI32
			(http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm). Some
			text editors also allow you to edit the .bsp without corrupting it in the
			process, but Notepad and Wordpad are unreliable for this purpose. Make
			sure you backup archipelago.bsp, as the chances are you will corrupt it
			first time especially if you're using a dodgy text editor. I repeat:
			backup the map before you start screwing around with it. Then open the
			map in your hex/text editor and search for the following text:

{
"origin" "-1664 3232 1472"
"initialstate" "1"
"triggermode" "3"
"globalstate" "void_th_gs"
"targetname" "void_th_eg"
"spawnflags" "1"
"classname" "env_global"
}
{
"origin" "-1600 3232 1472"
"triggermode" "3"
"globalstate" "void_tt_gs"
"targetname" "void_tt_eg"
"spawnflags" "1"
"classname" "env_global"
}

			Replace it with:

{
"origin" "-1664 3232 1472"
"initialstate" "1"
"triggermode" "3"
"globalstate" "void_tt_gs"
"targetname" "void_tt_eg"
"spawnflags" "1"
"classname" "env_global"
}
{
"origin" "-1600 3232 1472"
"triggermode" "3"
"globalstate" "void_th_gs"
"targetname" "void_th_eg"
"spawnflags" "1"
"classname" "env_global"
}

			In many text and hex editors, all carriage returns will appear as a
			little rectangle, making it harder to read. It's probably better to look
			and carefully alter what has changed in the text instead of just copy and
			pasting.
			Then save the file, and try to run the map. You should now teleport when
			you fall in the void. If Half-Life fails to load the map, it has been
			corrupted, you have changed stuff in the file you were not supposed to,
			or you should try a different text editor. If the map loads but other
			stuff in it is not working properly, you probably changed things that
			should have been left alone. If you fail to get 'teleport mode' as the
			default, try again with another copy of the map that you (hopefully)
			backed up. You simply made a mistake somewhere.

* noclipping, for anyone who does not know, is a form of cheating where you can fly around a map
and through walls.
