description:      My 1st Half-life level, unfinshed
                   and made before the release of 
                   the game. :] This was made possible 
                   due to the eveluation release of 
                   Build 718 of Half-Life which 
                   included a copy of WorldCraft 2.

info

i had to make a lights.rad file, as Build 718 did 
not come with it :[, at 1st i thought this was 
going to be a bit of a hassel, but in the end it 
was cool, and easy to do. qrad.exe does take a 
long time, but the effects are worth it i think 
in the end.

still not sure if i like the quake2 option of 
surface light editing values better than a 
lights.rad file, but, hey, its Half-Life not 
quake2 and thats just the way it is. 

basically HL rocks, and i think editing HL is very 
cool, i just cann't wait to get my hands on the 
final version a see how what its like in a 
DeathMatch!!
