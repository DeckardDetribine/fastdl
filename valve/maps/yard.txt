===================================================================================

Description : This is my first released map. No! don't delete it already, I said my first RELEASED map, i.e. I have made many others and this is the first that I consider good enough to inflict on the general public. I have read every map making tutorial I could lay my hands on (particularly HB's excellent multiplayer design treatise) and borne all the lessons of my previous pathetic efforts in mind. In particular I've kept a close eye on r_speeds and they are pretty good throughout. They never go above 670 and only get that high in one high up place.

It is designed as a deathmatch map to work with Opposing force and, although it will run as a plain halflife map, you will find that many items seem to be missing as they are OpFor only. It'll be playable but not fun.

The map consists of an upper and lower layer. The upper layer is walled in and contains three main areas in a fairly open arrangement. The first and largest area contains a crane with the rpg on top (hard to get to without falling). The next area is round the corner and features two crates with a few goodies on top. The final upper area is the shed type structure containing several worthwhile items including the sporelauncher.

The entire upper area is divided by walls which can be accessed by the ladders or gauss jumped to. They proved extremely effective in testing - the perfect place to drop grenades/satchels or snipe from. However, you are highly visible up there and I've made enough routes up to prevent anyone dominating.

There are three routes from the upper to the lower area, one from each upper area. The lower area consists of a canal and a pool, and will see less action than the top level. Its the perfect place to retreat to when you're low on health, but is not a camping spot. The Gauss is hidden somewhere down here. Get it: its very useful for jumping onto the walls up top.

A 2 or 3 player game sees a good number of frags and never gets too stale. 4 - 5 players is action packed and bloody but great fun. 6 and above is pushing it - you probably won't be alive long enough to get any decent weapon.
