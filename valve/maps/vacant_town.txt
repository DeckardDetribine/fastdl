Description		: This thing of a map :), is constructed in
			  a regular town-style. It has buildings with
			  second floors, many short rusty tunnels wich
			  lead the player in each section of the map.
                          The map has 5 buildings and one little
                          Also in this map you can find a
			  tower with an elevator in it and two MG´s
			  on the top of it. This tower is a fortress,
			  when two players use the MG´s and have
			  backup around the tower 
			  The idea of this map was, to merge best
			  possible speed and gameplay in opposite
			  of detail and itemplacement
			  If i made the right compromise between this
			  things...  well - play and have fun ;)
