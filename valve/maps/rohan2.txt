      This map is an improved version of ROHAN.bsp,
   
      fixes are:  1 previously if you tried to gauss jump you died
                  2 slightly better connectivity 
                  3 different textures which i like more
                  4 more weapons!!!! (the more the better i say)
                  5 and a few other little things  

to be honest not much has changed in this map, but i think the map
is more fun to play now.
