* Credits *

Magnus, Jack, and Paul at Black Widow Games.
Thanks to Barking Dog for Counter-Strike textures (used with

=========================================================

* Installation *

You must have a full installation of Half-Life (Ver. 1.1.0.1) or higher.
Run hldm5.exe to install the files to your Half-Life folder.
(default drive is "C", so change it if you installed Half-Life to a different drive).
They Hunger 2 is NOT required to play this version of Thdm5, therefore the
They Hunger weapons are not available in this map and have been replaced with
standard Half-Life issue.
