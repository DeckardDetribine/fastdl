==Map Info

	Deathmatch	: yeparoos
	Single Player	: no
	6-10 players recommended

==Map Information

	New Textures: none
	New Sounds  : nope

	This is my fifth release, paired with my sixth, the OpFor version of this map.

	Very rounded/circular, kinda dark closed corridor-based combat. Hopefully lives up to the name. This map is recommended for 6-10 players,
	but has a theoretical capacity of up to 20. I don't recommend that you try it, but it might be interesting. :)

==Construction

	Base: scratch
	Editor(s) used	: Worldcraft 3.3
	Compile Machine	: AMD Thunderbird 1.33 gHz, 512 mb RAM.
	Build time	: 7 days
	Compile time	: 8 minutes
	Playtest time	: I'm going to stop using this slot, not because I don't playtest, but because I have no idea how long it takes.

==Map Instructions

	Unzip "dm_phreneticism.bsp" into your valve/maps/ directory. Find a server playing the map (ha!), and join. Or create a server with the map. I like that idea.
