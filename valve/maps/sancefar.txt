This map was rather difficult to construct sensibly and keep the performance under
budget. There are locations where the r_speeds are rather high but they are mostly
views from the towers. I tried to break away from the casual blockiness of the
grid for whom we are all slaves to.

Other than that, artistically, i did much research and had drawn several notes.
After all that, I broke away from the notes since things always look better on
paper, once constructed, it looked like (@*Q&#. Texturing was another issue.
I found it better looking and more eye-pleasing to have smooth-vs-rough textures
through out the map. Thusly I made a basic minorly textured surface that I used as
a base for all of the other architectual surfaces. The skybox was also something i
dared to differ once again. I tried pink, brown, teal, but this time. YELLOW! It
ties the world together and really makes the details stand out euphorically rather
than forcing difference with two different colors, like green and blue.

This map truly examples how powerful the Half-Life 1 engine really is. As mentioned
before, the r_speeds r_shit, but managed differently. Since this is a giant map with
many details, this should murder the engine. However, using the methods described in
my journal about portal node sizes combined with a full-vis, the engine cut alot of
portals and rather sloppily auto-hinted the map. Yeah, sloppy, but rather efficient
since it halved the overall average r_speeds. If you really want to know the custom
settings for the batch compiler, here they are.
