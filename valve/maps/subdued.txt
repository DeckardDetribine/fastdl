Description         : I joined the Gangsta Wars team and did some experimenting with
                      UnrealEd, so it's been over five months since I released my last map
                      for HLDM. I finally got focused on making my fourth HLDM map, and this
                      is the result. This was the first map where I drew the whole level on
                      paper prior to starting on it, and I think because of that Subdued has
                      a better layout than any of my previous maps.

Jumbot Waypoint     : I've included a JRF file so you can play Subdued with Jumbots. It was
                      made by Scary_Jeff. Check out his site for maps and other JRFs at
