Description             :    This is a fairly militaristic map designed for small to medium battles. The layout is
			  based around a few small buildings, with a sewer system running along one side of the map.
			  This is the first map I have ever published, so if you like what you see or find a bug,
 			  E-MAIL ME!!!!
			     I designed this map to cater for a number of playing styles - Close quarter attacks,
			  Machine gun blasting, explosives, Sniping - all are equally effective.
			     I tried to keep the r_speeds low. They are around 600 (!) in one outdoor spot (I 
		 	  apologise to people with slower PCs) but this is the slowest point in the level. You're
			  going to have to take my word that this doesn't spoil the gameplay as there really is only
			  about 2 square metres of ground with this slow speed. Honest... (perhaps the guys at
			  radium will back me up on this....)
			     It's also worth mentioning that the metal door that gives the "Access Denied" sound is
			  purely decorative - so don't mail me asking how to open it..... :)
			     Enjoy!
