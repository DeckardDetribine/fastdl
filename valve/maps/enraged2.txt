Important note		: This is the second release of the map ... due to some unforeseen problems with the barrels :) It turned
			  out that any player pushing a barrel too close to a DM-start postion, was able to make respawning players freeze
			  when entering the game - completely unable to move from the spot.

			  I considered my options and decided that it was worth doing a second release. I'm aware of the hassle
			  which 2 versions may well cause, but, considering the great response I gotten to the map so far, I feel that
			  it would be a great shame to have a silly little thing ruin what otherwise is a very fun level.

			  The fix :- well quite simply raised respawn points where the base is one vertical pixel. This prevents barrels
			  from being able to slide onto them (which was previously possible with the teleport destination point.) I also 
			  fixed a couple of unaligned textures which had been missed the first time round :) I have also moved one of the DM
			  starts to the other side of the cellar room because the raised respawn point didn't look right in its original 
			  position.

			  I'll take the opportunity to thank everyone for their comments .. and I promise to beta test more thoroughly in the future.

Description             : Well I'll have to say it - I didn't think I'd do another one for Half-Life. I'm quite 
			  disappointed with HL multiplayer on the Internet so far, but in expectation of a patch I did this.
			  The release of Enrage coincides with the release of the 1.0.0.8 patch ... I've got my fingers
			  crossed - who knows even HL may be rocking on the net soon.

			  Enraged is a quite typical of my design style. I like levels to be deathmatch locations as opposed to
			  being "real" urban places. I like the outpost/deserted feel. It shouldn't feel like a shop or an office.
			  Enraged doesn't feel like an office anyway :) so I'm happy, and it is intentional. I'm still aiming for
			  typical server/lan setup .. with about 4 to 12 players. I like the result although I've found myself
			  in a tight situation .. not really knowing which way to go with the detail/r_speeds issue. I've kept 
			  them in mind the whole time but this level IS detailed .. and the price is normally high. It doesn't 
			  give the "unable to draw surfaces" error in software at any point,  .. but I wouldn't play Enraged with
			  a software based PC anyway. For that matter I wouldn't play Half-life in software at all. I think this
			  level will play well with a nice Voodoo II/PII combination - so go and buy it !!  

			  A big thankyou to littlemute for letting use his vickers1920 gun model in Enraged. It saved me the time
			  designing my own gun. I think it looks really cool. I adjusted the sound, flare size and accuracy but 
			  the model is the original. 

			  He can be gotten hold of here :- tajomaru@execpc.com or littlemute@woodenmen.com
