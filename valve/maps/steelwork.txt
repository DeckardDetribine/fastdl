Description		: one more big map with a thick atmospehre
			  from me for all the teamplay-server around
			  the web. this map is constructed like a
			  steelwork and the textures and sounds are
			  styled in the theme. in the map there are
			  3 secret rooms with stuff in there.
			  look out for lightings on wallbottoms and
			  sign on the walls around. an crate in the
			  outdoorarea is a teamfeature. but also one
			  player can push the cranebutton and reach
			  the RPG under the crate.
			  thats it for now..			  
			  
Additional Credits to   : the clanmembers of Raising Inferno for
			  testing the map and give me comments
			  on gameplay and texturing :)
