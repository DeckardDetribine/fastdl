 Special notice: 

I made this map in memory of a good friend that lost his life in a car accident, he was only 19 years old.
Don`t let the spirits of pain conquer the God of Iron, forever in our hearts...

 About map: 

Nice looking map(11081 faces), I have been inspired by Stalkyard and I wanted to make something small.
Rspeeds are quite good, around 800 in a few tweaks...could easy cut down the count to 400, but i like details.
Weapon placement is fit for good game flow, think the map is perfect for a 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. 
With 2 lj's its not so easy to dominate the map...

                                                    - - -
