LEVEL DESCRIPTION
=================
This map is my entry for the Snarpit (www.snarkpit.com) 'themed' mapping competition. I started this map a couple of years ago and originally intended it to be a Japanese water-garden, but then I played Ico and the map went in a different direction. As i've been working on the map for so long, it has gone through many iterations, starting with some shockingly poor attempts at a 'crumbled castle' look. As I grew more confident with the vertex manipulation tool, I was able to achieve what I had envisioned from the start (after the water-garden though!). Anyway, as you may have guessed, the theme of this map is that of an old run down castle. Apologies for the weapon placement - it's not my strong suit!

KNOWN BUGS
==========
The .mdl lights don't look bright enough on the actual lamp. Again, nothing can be done about this without spoiling the atmosphere of the map, as in order to fix it, I would have to make the light entities brighter, thus killing the ambience of the underground/indoor areas.
