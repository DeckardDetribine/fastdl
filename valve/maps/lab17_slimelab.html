<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Mid afternoon.</p>

<p>This is Research Lab <span class="extra" title="... but don't let the number mislead you into thinking there are 16 others.  There aren't.  Yet.">#17</span>, buried deep underground on a remote island.  When the subterranean river of slime was first discovered, along with its unearthly fauna and mysterious crystalline growths, a nameless branch of the government scrambled to install a research facility to explore its potential for military applications.  Soon after construction was completed, the installation suffered structural damage due to the inexorable growth of the crystals embedded in the surrounding rock.  In particular, part of the rail tunnel -- connecting the laboratory itself with the warehouse and the outside world -- weakened and collapsed.</p>

<p>This level consists of the laboratory itself, and living quarters for the handful of scientists who spend their days here poking and prodding slime to see what makes it tick.  Or squelch.</p>

<p>The entry section and warehouse exist separately as <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/mapping/levels.php#storage">Lab17: Storage</a>.</p>

<h2>Story</h2>

<p>What story?  It's DeathMatch: just kill anything that moves, and have fun!</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>All the weapons can be found in this level, but they are not necessarily easy to pick up (in fact, the Egon Backpack is visible in the <span class="level">Quake</span> variant, but not accessible.  It hasn't moved from its location in <span class="level">SlimeLab</span> -- but you'll know why you can't get it when you see how the level has changed.)  Watch your step -- and don't go swimming.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>I would appreciate feedback from anybody who likes (or dislikes) this level.  If you have something to say about this level, or an error to report, please <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/contact_pete.php?subj=Lab17_SlimeLab">contact me</a>.  Without feedback, how can I hope to improve?  :-)</p>

<h2>Playtesting</h2>

<p>Both versions of this level have been extensively playtested by the following people, all of whom have made comments contributing to the finished product:</p>

<ul class="data">
<li title="aka 'itson'">Shaun Barclay</li>
<li title="aka 'wiersbowski', most of the time">Ben Davies</li>
<li title="the author, aka 'phoenix', aka 'darkphoenix'">Peter Jones</li>
<li title="aka 'dead girl'">Karen McKavanagh</li>
<li title="aka 'target'">Kim Stallard</li>
<li title="aka 'doctor'">Grant Wheatley</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="level">SlimeLab</span> seems to be slightly slow with only three people, but four to six seem to work out pretty well.  I suspect it would support as many as sixteen players before becoming too crowded -- this is a large level!  <span class="level">Quake</span> has a smaller playable area, and while it can be a little slow with two people, three or more plays quite well.</p>

<h3>Revision History</h3>

<h4>Version 1.1 -- May 22, 2005</h4>

<p>This is (hopefully) the final release of <span class="level">SlimeLab</span> and <span class="level">Quake</span>.  I have fixed all the glitches I could find.  The worst ones were:</p>

<ul>
<li>The force-field generated by the two huge crystals in the outer West area would occasionally not disappear again when it should; this has been overhauled and now works differently; hopefully the changes have fixed the glitch!</li>
<li>It was possible to spawn inside the pushable barrels; this has been prevented.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0 -- April 5, 2005</h4>

<p>After playing <span class="level">SlimeLab</span> for a while, and putting the finishing touches on <span class="level">Quake</span>, it is time to release them to the rest of the world.  Some of the features I have added to these levels will also be flowed back into <span class="level">Storage</span>, for the sake of consistency.  For a more detailed look at the history of the intertwined development of all four Lab17 levels, see <a href="http://www.petesplace.id.au/download/hldm/lab17/slimelab_history.html">Lab17: History</a>.</p>

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

<ul class="spaced">
<li>I really blew the budget with this one.  (One just needs to look at the compile times to see that!)  Some areas are just way too complex for the software display driver to handle.  All I can recommend is that you run this level under the OpenGL driver, or not at all.  I am sorry if this inconveniences anyone, but I really cannot see a fix for it without completely redesigning the level.  I promise my next level will be a lot more playable for all.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Credits</h2>

<p>Thanks go to the following:</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li><a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve Software</a>, for producing this great game, and giving us the means of creating our own levels.</li>
<li>The Playtesters (listed above) for their feedback and suggestions which helped make this level better than it would have been without them.  Also for their &quot;gentle nudging&quot;, which helped me stay focused on finishing!  Particular thanks go to Ben Davies; we have held several design discussions, bouncing ideas back and forth, and these levels would not be half as good without his input.</li>
<li><a href="mailto:evilchild@lowlife.com">evilchild</a> for the bunk bed prefab, which I found at the <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/prefablab/">Prefab Lab</a> (under 'Decorative'.)  My beds are (very) loosely based on his -- which I actually found to be a little on the large side, so my first step was to scale them down.  All that remains from the original prefab is the mattress design...</li>
<li><a href="mailto:carlos@picklepc.com">Carlos Salgado</a> for his flatbed train prefab.  It fit my pre-determined rail spacing perfectly.  I found it at the <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/prefablab/">Prefab Lab</a> (under 'Vehicles'.)</li>
<li><a href="mailto:Dakushna@aol.com">Brian J. Audette (AKA Lord Dakushna)</a> for the clock prefabs. Ever since I first saw them I've been wanting to include them in a level.  I ended up modifying them somewhat -- I tweaked the rotation speed of the hour hand for accuracy, and changed the shape (and colour) of the second hand -- but without this prefab I'm not sure I'd have known where to start.  I found it at the <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/prefablab/">Prefab Lab</a> (under 'Decorations'.)</li>
</ul>
