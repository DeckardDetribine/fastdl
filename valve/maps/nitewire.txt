Installation		: Unzip nitewire.zip into your sierra/half-life/valve/maps directory and
                          join a game with nitewire.bsp!  Or if youd like to run around in it, 
                          run "hl.exe -console +map nitewire.bsp". Have fun!
Notes                   : Let me just warn you that the size of the file is extremely big and
			  definately shouldn't be downloaded from a server, unless you have a really
                          high speed modem.

			  Also, the reasons you may find high r_speeds are simple. In regular
			  deathmatch maps you dont see large chunks of the level from one area,
			  like these types of maps do. So if you really want good speeds on levels
		          like this and On a wire, you'll probably want a fast processor. It's
			  probably best to turn the decal amount down to about 100-1000. To do 
		          this, bring down the console and type "r_decals 100". Turning off your
			  view weapon is also suggested, which is done by bringing down the console
			  and typing "r_drawviewmodel 0".
