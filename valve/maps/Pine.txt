>>>> Known Bugs >>>>

<1> The glass in the lower area can't be broken with RPGs, contact grenades, and the crowbar (at least I wasn't able to.)
<2> In software mode the 'fire' doors that seal off the lower area after the glass is broken appear to be black.
<3> Again in software mode part of the turret on top of the bunker flases in and out of existance occasionally.

>>>>>>> Areas of intrest >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The lower area in the complex is an observation area so people can look out under the water. This glass wall 
can be shot out causing the lower area to flood.

>>>>>>> Spoilers>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

There are snarks in the freezer in the break room. (the freezer only opens from the outside so don't stay in too long) 

The snack and soda machines are health and HEV recharge stations

There is a ledge across from the bunker (with the turret) that can only be accessed by gauss jumping. 

There are two gauss guns in the level. One in the sewer and one in the dark area above the long ramp 
going to the lower part of the level that you need the long jump module to get to.

The 2 rocks in the aquarium are just far enough below the water that if you crouch you will be completly under the
water. 

The glass in the observation area can be shot out from either side. It has a random amount of health generally between
50 and 150 health, this way you never know for sure when it will break.
