Map Description         : This is a small, arena-esque map for the Snarkpit "contrast arena" comp.
			  The contrasts (which I hope are obvious enough not to need me to explain)
			  are hot and cold, or more precisely - lava and snow. R_speeds creep up a
			  tad in places but the main point of this competition was to create a map
			  with exciting and contrasting visuals. It is playable on a Duron 800 with
			  a 32mb Geforce2 mx, so if you have a more impressive spec than that you
			  should get by ok. The snowfall also hits the FPS a fair bit but is crucial
			  for the competition. Perhaps if enough people care I will make a version
			  with less FPS eating things in it.

Misc Author Info        : This is my eight map release. I am an 18 year old currently studying
			  BSc Computer Games Technology at the University of Abertay in Dundee,
			  Scotland. Fingers crossed after getting this degree I will become a
			  fully fledged Level Designer working in the industry :) Outside of level
			  design I am a skateboarder, rollerblader, ice skater and snowboarder.
			  I listen to ska/punk music and play a helluva lot of computer games :)
