** PLAY INFORMATION **

SINGLE PLAYER:
Just to familiarise yourself.

MULTIPLAYER:
2-8 players. 4-6 seemed the ideal amount. 16 respawn points are included.

DESCRIPTION:
A fast and furious small map with plenty of crossovers & good connectivity. No theme as such (unlike my previous maps which each had definate themes), just a consistent visual style running through the texturing. Plenty of stock weapons around, and 1 of each of the "better" weapons.

PLAYING:
Just one thing to mention really, in that the 4 narrow hallways in the middle of the map have pools of slime in little depressions in the floor...the slime is actually teleports. Step down onto the centre beam, collect whatever ammo is there, then fall off into the slime to be transported to a weapon. ie, collect the crossbow ammo & fall into the slime and you'll teleport to the crossbow, whereas collect the gauss clips & fall off and you'll teleport to the gauss, etc. Sure, you can just collect the weapons from around the map, but by teleporting to the weapons you'll have more appropriate ammo. You can also gauge where each teleport takes you...the left-most teleport takes you to the furthest westerly point of the map, going through to the right-most teleport, no surprises for guessing it takes you to the furthest easterly point. After a few teleportations you'll pick it up.

Hope you like The Bone Collector. I'd appreciate feedback too...to my email address at the top of this text file. It's a major commitment putting in the time to design these damn maps, so I fully welcome any & all constructive encouragement / ideas / criticisms / praises. Job offers welcome too!!
