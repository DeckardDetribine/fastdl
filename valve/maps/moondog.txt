* Author/Map Information *

I am currently working on two bachelor's degrees. One of which is Business Management, the other being Psychology at the
University of Missouri.

If you like what you see, and have an *interesting job offer*(full time, paid, relocation, etc) pass it along. I am not actively
seeking a position anywhere, but I will certainly entertain any offers.

This map was designed while working on a "yet to be announced project". About two weeks ago I completed Lunar Space Depot, and
I felt the urge to create something non space-like in Half-Life. If you like this map, you will probably also like Lunar Space
Depot. They are both designed for fast play, with 2 to 6 players. You can download any of my maps from all around the world,
directly from http://www.planethalflife.com/aerotic.

R_speeds are very low for most of the map. So you low enders should run OK. Tops is around 475(only in one area),
and the average probably around 225.

The name of the map has some historical significance. Why was the Rock and Roll Hall of fame placed in Cleveland? The name of
the map is the answer. Alan "Moondog" Freed is a famous Disc Jockey who was credited with being the first to play Rock Music.
He got caught up in Payola, and McCarthy, was eventually blacklisted and then died a lonely death.

Enjoy!
