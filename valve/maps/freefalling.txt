Freefalling.bsp
Authors: Luke Stillman and Max Jenkins

In this map, we tried to get the feel of both verticality in fighting and play styles 
as well as a range of different play areas with both differences in lighting and 
also quick fighting and slow fighting.  Also it attempts to cater to both close quarters
fighters and snipers.  Have fun.  Good hunting.  

Please don't take anything from the map without consent from the authors, who aren't going
to give contact information 8-)
