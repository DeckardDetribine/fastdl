DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
=====================

- This is designed to be a small map in every sense. The 
  recommended number of players is two or three.  Absolute
  maximum of four if you want a very frenzied game.

- The recommended time limit is 15 minutes, and the recommended
  frag limit is 20.  Told you it was small :)

- This map is designed for small Lan games, and for people who
  want to host an internet game, but don't have a dedicated
  server.  The map runs fine hosted on, for example a cable
  modem as long as you stick to the recommended player limit.

- wpoly speeds are fine, but you may notice epoly speeds rising
  as the dead bodies pile up.  The epoly speeds are similar
  to those in the floodable room on Undertow however, so 
  shouldn't pose a problem.  Also, the map has been tested both
  on a Lan and the Internet, and the speed was never a problem.

- Depending on how well this map is received, this will be the
  first in a limited series of small maps suitable for quick
  games.

MAP FEATURES
============

- By climbing up the glass tube, you will be able to push a 
  button which will flood the lower levels of the map.
  At the same time though, the room containing this button
  can be hit by a blast of steam by pushing one of the two
  buttons on the ground floor of the map.  This means, if you
  see someone climbing the glass tube, you can either try to
  reach the top floor before them for an ambush, or quickly
  get to one of the steam buttons and fry them.

- The flood button resets after about one and a half minutes,
  at which point it can be called again.

- The RPG, Crossbow, snarks, and magnum have been left out
  of the level.  The RPG made killing too easy, the action
  is too fast for the crossbow, snarks just fall to the bottom
  of the level, and the magnum was just annoying :)

- The Egon and Hornet gun have been left out since the Egon
  was just too powerfull, and I never include Hornets.

Thanks to Ben Morris for Worldcraft, and Valve for the
obvious.

Thanks to the playtesters for their input.
