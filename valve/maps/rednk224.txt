A NOTE ON R_SPEEDS:  
--------------------
This map has quite a bit of detail in some places, but not as much as 
I originally tried to include.  The poly & face counts were just too high, so
I had to get rid of some extra detail in the larger rooms (rails, etc.)  

Considering that the wpoly counts don't break 600 in most places, 
I think I did a pretty decent detail job.  I like it, anyway. 
With the details that USED to be in the map, they topped 900... not too 
great, especially on a medium or low-end machine.

Note:  I did NOT test this map in "software" mode.  Only in hardware.
You may get bent out of shape that I'd release a level without
testing it in software rendering mode.  Get used to that concept... 
it appears to be the way of the future.

Also:  There are some little quirks you MAY find, I fixed all the 
ones I was able to see.  Email me if there are any 
bugs you notice.  There is an area where VIS reported "leaf portals
saw into leaf", but it doesn't appear to cause a problem in the game.
