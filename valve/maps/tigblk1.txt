Info

Developed as the 1st of 3 BLOCK maps for 1/2 Life.
(Depending on the success of this one)

Each building is designed for ease of access and escape.
There are no real dead ends in any area. (Thank God)

The Blue Building contains the most health and best mix of weapons,
with long hallways and smaller rooms.
The Yellow Building contains all metal floors that will really give
away your location, but offers larger rooms.
The Ruins (Actually incomplete buildings) are wide open spaces that
offer some great hide and stalk options.

Ammo is kinda heavy for the MP5 (light on MP5 grenades)
Tons of shachel charges and hand grenades.
Grenades can be thrown from the ground level into second
floor windows.

r_speeds are always low and you should enjoy play on all
machine speeds.
