Description         : I've been mapping for about 18 months now, and Feud is my fifth HLDM
                      level. I've tried to keep improving with each release, and I don't
                      think this map breaks that trend. Feud has better architecture than
                      Subdued, Rorshach's textures are amazing, weapons aren't as sparse as
                      they were in Subdued, and Feud isn't huge and empty like Subdued was.
                      At first mapping was a struggle, but now it's my favorite thing to do.
                      Hopefully you can get some enjoyment out of the level.

Jumbot Waypoint     : I've included a JRF file so you can play Feud with Jumbots. It was
                      made by Scary_Jeff. Check out his site for maps and other JRFs at

Bugs                : -Half-Life's lifts still suck. The lift can get stuck in the up
                      position if it is blocked, but if you walk underneath the lift it will
                      fix itself.
                      -Sometimes the lasers over the egon don't go all the way to the floor.
                      I'm not sure what causes this.
