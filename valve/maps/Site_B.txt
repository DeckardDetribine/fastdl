BACKGROUND
==========

Black Mesa was just the beginning. 


A network of interdimensional portals, will bring a new 
future for mankind.  No longer confined to a planet of 
dwindling natural resources and increasing polution, 
portal technology will provide limitless rewards.

Our sphere of influence will envelop every dimension, 
every species.  Should anyone, or anything, disagree 
with our plan, well... I'm sure they can be... persuaded.


Site B is the first of our next generation portal 
generators.  Based on Gekler's theory of Ion acceleration, 
Gyroscopic streams of sub-atomic particles are used to 
bombard a single barinium core.

The resulting Ion flux will generate enough energy to rip
through the interdimensional barrier, creating a stable
rift between two worlds, under our control of course.


At least, thats the theory.


As anyone familiar with Geklers work will remember, the 
rather... Imaginative assumptions he made when developing
his theory have presented us with a few... small problems.

The interdimensional barrier is proving to be more 
stubborn than we had expected.  Indeed we have yet to 
create a stable interdimensional portal, although we 
have had more success with smaller, localised portals 
contained within the complex.

Unfortunately, that is not the biggest problem.  It seems
the Ion flux generates more energy than antisipated. 
More energy than we can use.  From time to time, this 
build-up must be dissipated in order to maintain 
stability.  Currently, the only known way of doing this 
is to allow the core to overload, and release the energy
as a wave of ionic radiation.  

This can have a somewhat... negative effect on a persons 
health, so the complex must be evacuated once the process
has been started.  Should anyone remain inside, well... 
I suppose they will be leaving our dimension a little 
sooner than expected.


But these are minor problems, which we are confident 
will be resolved in time, after all, given enough 
insentive, we can be a very resourcefull species...


============================================================

This deathmatch map is based in the aformentioned Site B
complex, and wouldn't you know it, the only elevator out
is broken so you are trapped inside(what a surprise!).

============================================================

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
=====================

- I wanted to create a map which would:

	* Provide an enjoyable deathmatch for a full 
          complement of players.

	* Provide an interesting and appealing setting,
          allowing a variety of tactics.

	* Knock "Enraged" off the number 1 spot at
	  Radiums Top 10 ( no offense Scary-one :) )


- Having been inside two different power stations (one 
  coal, one nuclear), it is very noticable that they both
  shared the similarity of containing very large, 
  cavernous rooms.

  This is the look I was going for with this map.  
  A kind of hi tech power generating installation 
  type thingy.

- I was very aware of monitoring R Speeds when constructing
  this level, and I think you should find this map will run
  nice and fast on most platforms. The R Speeds stay around
  150 - 350 in the magority of the map.

- There are a number of small teleporters which link parts
  of the map together to aid connectivity, and to keep 
  withing the theme of the map.

- In the control room, you will find a button which will
  trigger an overload of the main reactor.  This will 
  sound a 1 minute warning, before the core reaches 
  critical and the Ion wave fires.  The only safe place 
  in the level is the basement area, which is sealed off
  just before the wave.  This is the same principal as 
  the airstrike in Crossfire.

  The Overload takes 3 minutes to reset, at which point it
  can be called again.

  Just as in Crossfire, if more than one person makes it 
  to the safe area, I don't want people to just be able 
  to hide in there until after the blast.  To ensure this,
  the basement is very open and contains some powerfull 
  weaponry(Gauss, crossbow, & rpg).

  Camping should be minimised by the placement of these
  weapons, as each is vulnerable to at least one other.

- There are two ways to activate the lift:

 	*If the lift is already here:  Simply pass in 
         front of the lift button as you step onto the 
         lift.  You will hear a beep as the lift is 
         activated.

        *If the lift is not here:  Pass in front of the 
         button to call the lift(again, a sound will 
         indicate this), then once the lift arrives, 
         pass in front of the button again as you step 
         onto it.

  It only takes a few seconds to get the hang of this.  
  We playtested the map with a variety of button/trigger
  styles, and this was definitely the best.

- A lot of effort was put into the details of this level,
  and as far as I know, there are no misaligned textures.

- There +IS+ an Egon on this level, but because it is 
  such a powerfull weapon, particularly over long 
  distances(of which this map contains many), it is in
  a secret area.  Be imaginative and I'm sure you will
  find it.

- There is no hornet gun. 
  I don't like the hornet gun.  
  So there!

- Don't overlook the usefulness of satchels in this level.
  The elevator and air vent can provide some very devious
  frags.

- A gauss blast will penetrate most walls in this level.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
======================

*HUGE* THANKS to Dax a.k.a [TRI]Nose_Hair for letting
me ambush his PC for test compiles, and for suggesting
the glass blast doors(just wait until you see someone
trapped outside!).

Thanks to Spaceweasel for the encouraging review of
my first map, Nightshift, and the rest of the Radium
bunch for providing the site.

Thanks to Ben Morris for Worldcraft.

If you play this map(and even enjoy it)I would certainly
appreciate an email.
