Description
--------------------------------
A large deathmatch level of an alien ship submerged at the bottom of the ocean.  The level is very dark, so remember to use your flashlight.  It is designed to work well with any number of players.  It was made for normal Half-Life deathmatch, but you can try it with whatever mod you want.

The Story
--------------------------------
An ancient alien ship has recently been discovered at the bottom of the Pacific ocean, buried deep under several miles of rock.  Carbon dating shows that it crashed somewhere around the Triassic period, and the insides are in near-perfect shape.  With so much advanced technology in one place, no one is about to sit around while others pick away at it.  Soon the world powers are fighting over the remains.  Everyone wants a piece of the pie.  And now things have become violent...
