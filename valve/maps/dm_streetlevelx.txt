Info

Streetlevel is a deathmatch map for Half-Life.
It's a medium sized city based map good for about
10 - 15 people. It takes place in a more or less
ghetto area, there is no real story but the year
is not current and somewhere around 1999 - 2000.

Fun Facts

This map took about a month to make:
2/21/11 - 3/27/11(beta phase)

There was going to be a unique secret room with 8 bit
music. Sadly it would not fit and there had to remove
it.

There are 2 secrets, and yes that is me in the cubicle.

Another cut area were the sewers. I had already designed
them half way through the maps progress. The problem was
it took up to much resources and didn't alter gameplay.

The name of the map is from this song:

"Streetlevel" by Xela

Updated by Xawari in 2018.
With all those func_walls around, this map was barely
playable, but had a lot of potential. Since the source
was provided, I decided to fix some technical issues
so the map has now almost no FPS drops. There are other
fixes, like textures and architecture. And some additions :)
