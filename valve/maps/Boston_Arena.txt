				help and opinions.

Note from Luke Boston:		This is a very small multiplayer map.  It is
				recommended that you use it for 1 on 1 
				matches, but 3 way and 2 on 2 seem to be
				fine here too.  A lot of attention has been
				put into skillfull tactics and there are many 
				vantage points for you to take up.
