===========-Map discription:===================================  

This is a rats scale map based in an attic.  I placed glowsticks (the kind we all played with as kids on holloween) all 
around the map for a glowing flourescent feel.  I didn't go with the lighted textures such as the flourescent textures 
in HL instead I tried to make all the lighting make sence in the map.  I placed glow in the dark stickers, a glowing acid 
substance in one area, holes in a tunnle area with beams of light entering and of course the grimlock arts room which is 
lite by flames.  The pink flooring in the walls is fiberglass insulation incase anyone out there has never seen whats inside 
the walls of wood based homes.  

============cool features:==============================

--KILL OSAMA, LOL.  I placed a book (some say it looks like a tape, lol) that you can shoot the face of osama and gibs fly.  
Also I placed a button right next to it that plays a funny little skit that I'm sure you'll be checking out more than once. 

--Cool drip effect's in two areas in the map  

--Jump in the acid can to get the egon gun , you'll hear a nice suprise, lol

--There are two "secret" warp points in the map, you'll find them if you look closly around

--I places alot of art work in the map including a pic of my bass guitar.  The artists are very talented, check it out

--The egon gun is behind the 3-d GRIMLOCK, the flames do damage so you'll have to move fast, grabing the gun upsets the 
grim-demonds(triggers wav file) so others may hear you in the room grabing it!!

--I placed shootable cycler models(the skeletons in the GRIMLOCK room).  Shoot em to watch them move and for a little fun 
target practice

--Some custom textures made by myself and Dr Atlantis including some basic book end text.

--Shoot the light switch to turn on the light for 40 seconds.  Why not leave it on and and shot it to turn it off for 40 
seceond?  Well, take a look at the glowstick glow, I wanted to preserve it also its an attic so naturally it is dark.

--Shot the radio for a laugh, lol, literally

--take alook around, see if you can find anything else(maybe I'm forgeting something)


==================Other releases==========================

starcraft1-ro.bsp  just a quick release of part of what was going to be a tfc map (one of two comand centers, it was based 
on the game "starcraft" by blizzard) it is still an interesting map

And of course more to come, 

a very complicated trek map, many interactive elements

More rat scale maps posably

and more.........(work in process)


==================Need to know Info========================
  

IMPORTANT:  There is a sprite file used in this map "flames.spr" that needs to be places in the valve\sprites folder.  
If you run it on a server people will automatically download it

In creation of the jump pads I wanted to make sure no one would take damage when falling onto them so I included a 
Func_Water (water) which no matter how hard yo fall on cancels out the damage.  Basically you need to know this 
because aperiently servers override creater settings which causes the water to slow people down as they try to use the jump 
pads.  To correct this overide set your water friction to zero, the pads work great after that.
  
That seems to be the only thing to say about them except the pads work best when gravity is set to 800.

This is a dark map in alot of areas, its part of the enviroment I was trying to create so you may need to up your 
gamma correction so you can see brightly or ajust the brightness on your monitor.
  
There is some funny stuff in there that hopefully no one takes offence to, if you do then what can I say.........
don't play the level otherwise enjoy and have fun, after all, thats what it's all about right?

===============Map play modes===================================

single player start----yes, but no monsters, I placed one to take good clean screen shots
coop-------------------doesn't seem to work in HL at least the info_coop doesn't
Mulitiplayer-----------This is a multiplayer death match map


=================About me======================================

 I work best with no idea at all, not even my own, LOL.  Does that make sence?  No idea right? lol.  I'm the creative 
type, Gatta have an outlet what can I say, 3-d creation sounded pretty damn cool!!!  I actually like it more than 
playing the actual game LOL.  Now if only there were a way to make some money doing this stuff.....
