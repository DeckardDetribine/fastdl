		::: ADDITIONAL INFO :::
================================================================

This is our first map there are more to come, considering the Review Criteria of Radium, I dont excpect much from this map just testing the HL waters out.

Since I haven't Maped since the Doom2 days you might be able to notice the Doomish qualitys of the tight halls and less than open spaces.

Beauntoo was just learning lighting, so the lighting is abit novice.
