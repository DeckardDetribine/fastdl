About the map...

There is nothing to say, i like the light and some of the brushwork. 
The map layout is based for teamplay or deathmatch and the entitys are placed to keep you on the run.
This map is also a half convertion from my destiny map tp_tomb wich also is based around teamplay...

The rspeeds are quite low over all, with tops on 750 in one corner
It has 6276 faces wich is quite low (if you look at Tear, about 12000 faces)

Anyway...look for secrets and traps, the best way to find em is to open the bsp in sp mode and fly around
with noclip.
