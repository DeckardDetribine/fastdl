Email Address           : Theodor.Nilsson@home.se, please send me feedback on
			  this map.

Other levels by author  : This is my first released map.

Description             : Xen & real-world. Gravity is 0.8 of normal gravity.

			  The device in the test chamber is a teleporter.
			  Hit the yellow button in the control room, run into
			  the test chamber, stand in the teleporter (with the
			  yellow beams, which are completely harmless), and 
			  hope that someone doesn't hit the red button...
			  the teleporter will transport you to the egon.

			  The yellow pool is a health recharger.

			  Shoot the xen net in the cave to release the seven
			  midg... sorry, snarks.

			  Lastly, turn the handles on the blue pipe or the 
			  rusty cylinder to trap people who are going for the 
			  crossbow and the sniper tower.

			  The RPG is located in the crate on top of the cargo
			  container.
			
			  r_speeds should be fine for most systems.

Included weapons	: 2 shotguns, 2 mp-5's, 1 hivehand, 1 crossbow, 1 .357
			  magnum, 1 egon, 1 rpg, some satchel charges, a few 
			  handgrenades, and a bunch of snarks.

Revision changes 	: I've improved item placement, and made the fire trap 
			  more effective. The sniper tower is no longer 
			  accessible from the hallway when the fire is on. 
			  Also, you can't see the Egon from the sniper tower 
			  anymore. One mp-5 has been added, I've reduced the 
			  amount of handgrenades and satchel charges, and the 
			  jump module has been moved to a better spot, making 
			  the RPG a bit easier to get.

			  I've made a few architectural changes to reduce w_polys,
			  connectivity has been increased a bit.
			  I happened to read a "natural terrain" tutorial at RUST,
			  so the Xen areas look more organic now.

Thanks to               : Evilchild for the "Xen Altar" prefab and his DoE site,
			  the testers at DoE for tips & feedback.
			  If you are a mapper, or want to help testing user-made
			  maps, I strongly suggest you pay 
			  http://halflife.lowlife.com a visit.
