* Notes *

 This is the final revision of Ramage, thus the suffix FV (Final Version).  The following are most of the revisions I can remember.

1) Light fixtures no longer snag you when you run by.
2) Lighting tweaked and added visual touches (wall decals, box retexturing, etc.)
3) Extra ammo for the RPG removed.
4) Stairs are textured properly now and ladder textures fixed.
5) HEV charger removed.
6) Added a locked bay door for a simulated entrance.
7) Additional spawning points added.


 What I wanted to accomplish with this .bsp was a fast moving, smooth deathmatch map that had a hint of military design.  Net games are the best on 56K with less than 4 people and good small maps are hard to come by.  I am very proud of what this map has become and I hope someone out there enjoys it.  

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated and welcomed (even bad :)

Currently working on a new Deathmatch level which I hope will add a tactical feel to the game.
