* Construction *
================
Base			: From scratch.
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft.

			  of Worldcraft and Quake 1 when there was
			  no such thing as brush clipping or vertex
			  manipulation or texture lock. 
			  You new guys have it EASY!
Compile Machine		: A VERY nice person compiled it for me 
			  since my PC could not handle the size. He 
			  will remain nameless to prevent him from 
			  being swamped with requests from other 
			  people with lame systems.
Compile time		: Don't know
Build time              : 6 weeks part time - hey, I have a life!

* Hints *
=========
Yes, there are snarks in the level, you just have to look...

There are a couple of ways to get to the rpg in the large silo 
room if you don't mind risking a long fall...

There is one "secret" door that's fairly easy to find...

You can turn the wheel to activate the bridge AND fire a gun at 
the same time as long as you stay facing the wheel...

Don't fall into slime...it hurts...

Dont' fall into the dark pit either...that hurts too...

=========================
* Design Considerations *
=========================
It's time consuming to get that egon. Your hands have to stay at 
the wheel to turn the access bridge making you very vulnerable.

Jump carefully to get the rpg in the big silo room or you'll
burn your toes.

The other rpg is easily accessible, but puts you in the line
of site of a crossbow sniper.

For a fun time, creep up the ladder inside the large rusty silo
and surprise that sniper.

I threw in ONE crate...just so I could be considered a true
Halflife mapper :)

You CAN jump down onto the main level elevator (with the white
concrete walls) from the upper level hallway and quickly hop 
off it to the floor below. It's a good way to cut off someone 
who's following you.

Clip brushes were used where necessary to reduce risk of 
getting "stuck." 

Lots of thought and effort went into connectivity. It's a large
map where you have to THINK about how to get to that certain
area you're looking for. With time, you'll learn the best routes.
Stand in just about any one place and think, "Let's see, I could 
go that way, or that way, or that way..." Most rooms have lots
of different ways in and out.

Even more effort went into lowering r_speeds. This map should 
be playable by just about anyone. That took both
creativity and a willingness to hack out stuff that was cool
but not necessary, not to mention pulling out a few tricks to 
reduce the polygon count.
