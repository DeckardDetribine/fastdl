Map Description	:

B2Dorm was inspired by the Rats series by Chris Spain, setting the
6-inch tall player in a college dorm room - a scale version of the
map designer's dorm room, to be more specific

Because of high level of detail in this map, it is recommended that
players have a video card, but software mode will work, just not as
well. Also, because this level is so large, relative to the player,
falling distances can be potentially quite far, so it is recommended
that realistic falling damage be turned off when setting up a game.

FEATURES: (Your reward for actually reading the ReadMe file)
Some cool stuff in the map that might be good to know...
 - The heater can be used as a bunker, which can be entered from the
    base or the left side, via the desk drawers.
 - The legs of the TV Cabinet and Fish Tank can be climbed like
    ladders, allowing access to the shelves
 - The bed chains on the loft can also be climbed
 - To gain access to the bookshelf sniper position with the crossbow,
    stand on the TV remote and shoot the TV to teleport there.
 - To gain access to the other bookshelf with the rocket launcher,
    use the elevator in the desk drawers in that corner of the room.
 - The microwave door can be opened by shooting the buttons
 - The dresser in the closet can be entered from the base
