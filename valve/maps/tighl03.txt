description:      Medium sized DM level. This is 
                   an *Old School Style* of map if 
                   you ask me, and its very heavyly 
                   based on a Clan Arena level i 
                   made a little while back.

                   things, there were a lot more but 
                   had to be removed as a the hlds.exe 
                   did not like things like the 
                   skeleton/stukabat.mdl :[

how to start      goto start/run (on the windows task bar) 
 in single        browse for your hl.exe (look in

                  once selected, don't hit run, add the 
                    following
                  hl.exe +map tighl03

info

r_speeds are important to me. :]

Spent more time on this map than i have on any 
other map in a long time, this map has had a lot 
of work done to it, but I personal think it is 
not *over done*. I was constantly trying new 
things, adding and removing sections and 
optimising the level in many different ways.

The *fly-by* in the single player mode took about 
5 hours to work out, but its a nice start, and 
something a bit special/different. there is a few
other things in SP that are not in the DM game.

i did have the skeleton and stukabats, and some 
assassins, but these had to be removed as the 
*orginal* dedicated Half-Life server did not have 
these .mdls in the pak file :[ i made it so they 
didn't appear in a DM game, but the server still 
spat the dummer.

if your interested in the *assassin* version 
(theres only a few, but the its a nice *look* 
around) just email me, and i'll send it to you

The architecture comes from my local environment, 
i have *borrowed* lots of parts of the old and 
forgotten buildings around me. these building 
themself are a bit of a miss-mash of styles and 
era's and i think you can see this being reflected 
within this map. My world is far from *perfect* 
and i hate the idea of a *perfect virtual world*, 
hence the use of the miss-mash style. When i 
walk around these old buildings i like to tying 
to workout which bits where constructed first and 
which came later, i can see this being 
refferneced in this level too, and i like it!

Base map was a Clan Arena level i designed a 
little while ago. i don't think there where any 
brushes that did not get move or changed during 
the construction of this map.
