Description:	At one time it was the entrance to the mines of
		unknown colonizers, but volcanic action drawns
		it with lava, and ventilation is full of poison
		gases now. Only desperados comes here for battle,
		where the burning pools lits their faces and
		creates ugly shadows. And somewhere upnear the
		sky is blue and pure...

Custom stuff:	sky, textures, detail textures, teleportation
		sound (choose one of two: Q3 or Painkiller),
		teleport's sprite.
