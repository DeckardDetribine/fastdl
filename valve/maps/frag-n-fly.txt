Description
--------------------------------
A very large goal-based teamplay deathmatch map geared towards clans and hardcore players.  The map is 32 stories high with 5 symmetric levels consisting of platforms and ladders.  Players start at the bottom and make their way up to the goal at the top, and prevent the other team from reaching it.  20 frags are awarded to the team or individual who reaches it.

--------------------------------
Installation Instructions
--------------------------------
Unzip everything into your "valve" directory (e.g. "C:\Sierra\Half-Life\Valve") with "Use Folder Names" turned on.  The .BSP, .RES, and .TXT files will automatically go in your "maps" folder, and the .SPR files will go in your "sprites" folder.

--------------------------------
Rules
--------------------------------
* After joining the server or dying, you spawn inside a spectator pyramid.  No weapons are allowed or available inside the pyramid.You can use the camera monitors to watch the action from above.

* If the server is running Teamplay mode, and there are already teams playing or if your team lost the last round, stay inside the pyramid and watch until the round is over.  Watch the other players' strategy and formulate a plan with your teammate. 

* If the server is running Deathmatch mode, jump into any portal when you are ready.

* If the map has just started, jump into a portal with your teammate.  The team who got the most frags the previous round goes into the red "Winner" portal, and the team that was spectating goes in the yellow "Challenger" portal, to avoid confusion.

* To start the round and open the doors, each team has to press the green button in their lobby within 8 seconds of each other.

* If you die, just hop into either of the two portals and get going again!

* If you wish to spectate again, go into a lobby and press the button marked "spectate."

* Make your way to the goal portal at the top of the level, using the long jump module or tau cannon to get from platform to platform.  If you are a defensive player, PROTECT YOUR TEAMMATE AND PREVENT THE ENEMY FROM SCORING!  The player who reaches the goal scores 20 frags for his team, and teleports back to the bottom.

--------------------------------
Strategy
--------------------------------
* Not everyone will be able to make the jumps.  That's OK, the jumps get pretty hard.  Try holding down crouch while you longjump.

* Playing defense is just as much fun as playing offense!  If you can't manage to score a goal yourself, let your teammate do the scoring and protect him from below.

* If you're playing offense, it's a good idea to drop weapons down to your teammate below, or open the tau cage for him. (You can bind the 'drop weapon' command to a key by bringing down the console with the ` key and typing "bind <key> drop", where <key> is any key on the keyboard.)

* Half-Life voice communication can help out a lot in this map.  Ask your teammate to cover you when you are near the goal, and tell them where you or the enemy is.

* Each side of the map is marked by a color (red, green, yellow, and blue).  You can quickly tell your teammates where you or the enemy is by color and level number (e.g. "Cover me, green 5.").
