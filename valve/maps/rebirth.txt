Map Description
-------------------------

In this level you spawn in an underground safe area, where no players have
access to weapons. 
there are 3 teleporters underground which fire you into the upper arena, whilst 
also equipping you with the Magnum, Machine-gun, Shot-gun, Crossbow, a jump
pack, and full H.E.V health. 
The upper part of the level consists of buildings connected by coloured tunnels, 
which hold ammo. There are also a few extra token weapons lying around.


Bugs / Notes
-----------------------------

due to the mechanisms which first strip you off  weapons, then equip you, 
there are potential bugs that may occur in this map, such as the odd player
spawning underground with a handgun, or being shot into the arena with no
weapons.. I have tested the map and everything seemed to work fine for me.
but given enough players in the map, im sure this could happen occasionally......

Since there's no weapons or fighting in the underground section, the engine
has less models to draw, hence i have allowed r_speeds to be higher than
usual in that part of the map.

The weapons missing from this level are :  Hornetgun, grenades, tripmines, 
handgun, and the egon.....
