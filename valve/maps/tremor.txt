Description             : It’s a facility after a small earthquake. That’s why the normal lights are off or broken and the emergency floodlights (red and blue) are on instead, and the machine room has water on the floor from a broken container and a machine broken and running electricity through the water.  Watch out, that stuff will shock you dead. Players will want to use their air acceleration when jumping from machine to machine.  Air accelerations means you should keep pressing the direction you want to go, even crouch in the air to get a little more air-time. I found that this map works well with about 3-6 people depending on how fast paced you like your DM. Personally, I like to creep around a bit and get the jump on the other players!  Also make sure that texture sounds are turned on when u play (you know where metal sounds like metal and concrete sounds like concrete when you walk over it) that way u can get a good idea of where the other players are.  Well have fun with it!!
