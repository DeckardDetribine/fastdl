INSTALLATION:

Unzip all of the 'Scorched' files into into ../half-life/valve/maps

NOTES:

Tau cannon & Gluon intentionally omitted - the weapons present fit in with the "realistic" visual theme (MP5, Shotgun, Magnum, hand grenades, etc.)

The Scorched.res file is for server operators only (to enable the custom skybox to be downloaded along with the .bsp map file itself.)

Comments/etc welcome. Enjoy.
