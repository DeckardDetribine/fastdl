Mad Props and thanks to Valve, Rebellion, The Makers of Oz (Willi, ToonCop and StarBreaker), Zoner, Autolycus and the Valve-ERC, the guys at Gracelessland and Wally, Underground_King at The Lower Level, and my ALIEN clanmates for beta testing and encouragement.  

---------Description------------------------------------------------
This map depicts part of a colonial supply depot owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the infamous "Company" from the Aliens series of movies. The colony has been overrun by Aliens, and some of the damage they have caused can be seen in the map.  

The map is fairly small, with weapons placed to provide a good deal of chaotic fighting.  Oz players should find this an ideal map for serious fragging.  Regular Half-Life players will enjoy strategic spots for sniping as well as good general gameplay.

Some of the textures used were converted from the "Alien vs Predator" game by Fox and Rebellion, using a great texture utility program called Wally.  They are embedded in the bsp file using the -wadinclude parameter of Zoners tools, so no additional wad file is needed. It does make the filesize much larger though.

I am a big Aliens fan, and my maps reflect this. I get bored with the same old "military camp" type maps, so I try to make maps that are more interesting, with a special theme.  

Any good mapmaker knows there must be a balance between playability and detail, and this is often the hardest part of mapping.  I tried my best to strike this balance.  Any and all feedback is welcome.  Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the map!
