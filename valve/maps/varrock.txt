HLDM Varrock (1st version):
     On June 2001 I was looking for ideas for new map and was thinking 
about making map based on RuneScape that I was then been playing for 5 
months. I first thought about making map on Lumbridge (small town in 
Runescape) but then Poro gave me idea of making map based Varrock which 
is largest town in game. So I started mapping based on paper drawings 
that I had made first. In a month map was done and released althought I 
had forgot to add ambience sounds. That's why I made new ent-only 
version of varrock Jan 2002 with new skymap and ambience sounds. 

OP4POW Varrock:
     About same time of releasing HLDM-Varrock-fix Gearbox released new 
long-waited patch for Opposing Force with some new gamemodes .. including
DeathMatch with PowerUps. I thought it would be cool if I made first 
op4pow-map ever :). So I made one-day op4pow-conversion from hldm-varrock 
and showed it to Mikee. The cereal boy didn't like it without sugar 
(and not even with big red sugar cubes).. and so I started slowly mapping 
op4pow_varrock. And now it's done!

HLDM Varrock SE:
     Got little pissed off because none plays POW maps much. So I decided
to make second Varrock for HLDM release. This probably will be the last 
map I ever make for Half-Life.

------Runescape Information------------------------------------------

If you haven't tried Runescape yet and haven't even heard about it..

RuneScape is a massive 3d multiplayer adventure, with monsters to kill, 
quests to complete, and treasure to win. You control your own character 
who will improve and become more powerful the more you play. (that was 
just a copy-paste from www.runescape.com)

It's all Java so it works with almost any OS/computer.

It's free!

I have played it for over year (since it opened Jan 2001) and still 
haven't gone throught every place. (It's huge!)

It's fun :)
