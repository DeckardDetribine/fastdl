Description		: Rigor is a small map, (4-12) players, that incorporates aspects from Crossfire and X-Fire into a nighttime theme.  It has two "killzones" that make for quick, Free-for-all gameplay.  The map was designed for speed in every area possible.  However, a few spots can peak at 850.  Everywhere else they are under 500.  Enjoy!

Additional Credits to   : Dave Cresci and Russell Brown for their input and playtesting.
