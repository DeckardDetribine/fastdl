------About This Map-------------------------------------------------

Originally an exclusive to Action Half-Life v1.0, I decided to do a quick HLDM version so more people could get to play it. Similar to some other HLDM maps, there is a 'nuke' that can be triggered periodically. In this case, the central room is the only 'safe' place and players must rush to reach it before the doors close on them! There are no spawns in that central room.


------Credits and Thanks---------------------------------------------

BORG for taking interest in this map and for his suggestions. And the lava glubbing sound.

Octave Doctor for the wind sound on the balcony.

****************
More Information:


I am experimenting with detail textures on this map, something added to the Half-Life engine later on.

These create a finer level of detail that you can see close-up on a texture.

Enabling them can cause a bit of lag on some systems (even higher end). I suggest trying them and seeing what you think.

The are OFF by default in Half-Life. You must enable them with the console command shown above. They can be turned on and off in-game in real time, so if you don't like them you can turn them right back off again with r_detailtextures 0

If they are causing performance issues, in addition to turning them off you may want to delete hldm_temple_detail.txt- this will stop them from being cached when the map loads.
