------Credits and Thanks---------------------------------------------
Valve for creating this game, Wavelength for their awesome tuts (http://www.planethalflife.com/wavelength/) 
and whoever plays/distributes/reviews this map :)


------Additional Info, Tips, and Notes-------------------------------
This level is designed around the Gauss gun with many hidden cliffs etc. to jump to.
I was going to only place spawn points inside the central building, making the outside a sort of hidden/hard to reach area for the Veterans, but decided against this because the outside area is the best part. There are also a lot of great sniper spots for the fans of the weapon and even a few places to camp (one of these places is a bit of a joke :) heh heh

This map will be included in my upcoming (probably released by the time you read this) mod Morbid Inclination. But I need the reviews so I also decided to release it for HLDM. I think it plays better with Morbid DM but....

Please send any questions or comments to me, I enjoy the feedback.
If you notice anything that could be improved or anything you think 
I should add please tell me.

------Known Bugs & Issues--------------------------------------------
The r_speeds do get quite high (800) in two areas. One of them was avoidable, but at the cost of connectivity, so I decided to leave it because it is a low traffic area (the cliff right outside the arena) and I have no idea why the r_speeds are so high in the second area. (behind the arena, under and on the over head walkway to the left of the jail type building)
