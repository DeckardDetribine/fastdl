Description		: Quite a small level, indended for 2 - 3
			  players. The r-speeds are quite high in
			  places, but I couldn't really avoid this
			  with mass re-structuring of the map, and
			  putting in a load more corridors.
			  There are a few places on this map with
			  individual sounds, so 1 - 1 is particularly
			  tense, because recharging / grabbing the
			  egon / riding the elevators gives away your
			  position almost straight away.
			  Note that the glass around the elevator and
			  high room are both bullet-proof, but the
			  glass linking the two is not.
			  If you're wondering where the name comes from it's
			  because of the fact that half of this level is
			  loosely based around the Ministry of Sound - a
			  nightclub in the UK.
			  Oh yeah, and in case you didn't catch it, this
			  is my first HL map. Not that that's any kind of
			  excuse, of course.

V1.1			: The trap around the gauss gun now works, and the
			  r-speeds are lower all around, due to moving and
			  lengthening of corridors. Oh, and there's a truck
			  in the loading bay now.

Additional Credits to   : Valve, id, Lord Dakushna (whose Laser Turret
			  prefab I butchered for my own purposes), and
			  ShadowByte (who made the truck prefab I used as a
			  basis for the *gasp* truck).

Single Player           : No
Cooperative Player      : No
Deathmatch Player       : Yes, 2-4 players
CTF2			: No
Difficulty Settings     : No
New Textures            : No
CD Track                : Insides, by Orbital. Okay, it's not *actually* on
			  the HL CD, but I find it provides a suitably creepy
			  ambience for most DM play.

* Construction *
Base			: From scratch
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 2.0
Compile Machine		: AMD K6-2 350, 192MB RAM
Compile time		: 50+ hours to make, 20 minutes to VIS, and around 10
			  minutes to light. Bear in mind, though, that a
			  quarter of the construction time was spent working
			  out how to get certain effects to work properly, like
			  the gluon and gauss traps.
