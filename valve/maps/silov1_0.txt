Here ya go kiddies, hopefully an arena with fast and furious action. One thing I've noticed 
is that there does not seem to be very many good arena maps out. Trying to avoid falling into 
that pit with this one. It's my first map so I'm still learning the aethetics of lighting and 
how to keep r_speeds down, but at least for the r_speeds I think I did ok. They generally stay 
under 200 or so for the most part and max out at around 720 or so and then only if you're 
looking from a few isolated points. Egon, gauss, and hornet seemed like guns that'd either be 
worthless or way too powerful for the hallways in this level, so they're not there. That and I
personally think the egon's a little too powerful anyway, along w/ my deep hatred and scorn of 
the hornet gun. 

Keep your eyes peeled in front and behind you when you're playing this cuz I made sure people 
could show up from both directions quite easily. Oh yeah, did I mention I hate campers? That'd 
be why I tried to make sure there's no place you could think about camping. For those that are 
interested, heed warning signs. If someone shows up in those cramped spaces I'm not going to be 
responsible for the consequences. ;), hehe. And don't try hiding in the rpg safe. The door will 
ensure agonizing and crushing pain for those that try. Weapons that are available include: 
shotgun, machine gun, satchels, snarks, grenades, rpg, and crossbow. 

Server op's should have weapon stay on when you play this.
