Description             : A nice city by night
			  I tried to create a map, where no one can feel save, 
			  you realy gotta keep on your toes, as you can not cover
			  all the angles.
			  This map is ideale for snipes, due to the large areas,
			  but a shotgun maniac can realy kick some b.t in the small
			  houses.

Thanks to               : Hans for testing and a crazy night
