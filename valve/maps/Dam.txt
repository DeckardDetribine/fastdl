---Additional Info-------
This level, by it's very nature, has a large open area in. I've done by best to ensure that r_speeds are sufficiently low, but in some places it creeps up a little high (the sniping point overlooking the front of the Dam has the highest point in the level). It's for this reason that the rock walls look a little boring & smooth!

If anyone would like the .map version of this, e-mail me.
