Warning                 : You must have version 1.0.0.9 or better of Half-Life to
                          play this map.                          

Description		: 2-4 player arena that comes complete with spectator area (no fighting).
                          Players inside the spectator area will be able to view fighting without
                          the fear of being killed due to special shielding and 2 ply glass pains.
                          Players inside spectator area will also be able to interact with the
                          action inside the arena through the Kill Switches located at each 
                          window. Switches include snark attack, toxic wash (radioactive stew),
                          airstrike and nerve gas. Use them wisely to drain life and armor from
                          opponents inside the fighting area before entering.
                          
                          Players inside the fighting area are awarded one point every 30
                          seconds. This is to keep opponents from getting ahead and not entering
                          the fighting area causing an automatic win.

                          When you begin the map, you will be without any weapons. You will need
                          to enter the fighting area via the teleport buttons in each spawn area
                          to recieve weapons. Upon teleport to arena you will recieve the weapons
                          that were displayed in the window case behind the teleport buttons. 
                          Weapons will only be recieved through teleport and killing your 
                          opponents and taking their weapon.
                                                                                         
                          There is ammo automatically supplied with each weapon upon teleport
                          and there is ammo inside the arena area. No weapons are present in the
                          arena other than your opponent's, so choose your weapon set wisely 
                          before entering.
                         
                    Note: Two players teleporting at the same time from the same teleport pad
                          will result in death to both players.

                          This was done to keep players from sticking
                          during teleport and one player being without weapons inside 
                          the fighting area. It had to be done this way. Remain clear of 
                          the teleporter if another player is pressing the switch.
                         
                          This map was designed for the small LAN here and to play against
                          bots but r_speeds were kept low for possibility of internet play
                          with small amounts of players.
                          
                    
                          
Challenges              : 1. To see who can rule the arena for the longest amount of time.
                          2. Go without any deaths or get best ratio.
                          3. Who can collect all weapons availible at one time without dying.
                          
                         
Weapons Included        : RPG, 9mmAR, Gauss, Shotgun, Crossbow, 357,
