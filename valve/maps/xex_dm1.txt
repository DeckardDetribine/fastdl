Other levels by author  : This is my first released map.

Description             : uhhh, a silo in the middle. quite dark. no big empty areas
		          really fast gameplay. Many tripmines. 
			  I made it because i love tripmines and I have no tripmine maps.
			
			  r_speeds should be fine for most systems.

Story			: you and your homosexual brother are arguing over a boy. 
			  you decided to fight a battle in an old nuke silo. The one who 
			  wins is the badest gay and have the rights to take the third boy. 
			  uhh.... you borrowed all the weapons from your father. he is an old 
			  drugdealer, also homosexual if you wondered. if there are 3 players
			  the third play the father. He wants to kill the third boy, because
			  he dont like redheads. if there are 4 players the fourth have to play 
			  the drugdealers wife. mattias is his name. if you wondered. 
			  you cant play more than four persons on this map, if so we will run
			  out of gays.
