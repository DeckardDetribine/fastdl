Other

This is the first map I have released. I tried to create a map that would be fun, and have a few quirks and a bit of originality. For one I dont think the ice thing has been done before in this way. I tried to put thought into weapons placement. And i omitted the egon, after seeing it dominate so many servers. Just incase people don't realise to get the RPG you have to move some crates around in the water. The guass is fairly easy to find as is the crossbow. I tried to take care with construction and I hope this is reflected in poly counts. Though this is my first release map so I am expecting criticism, which is fine. Please I invite any and all feedback. Thankyou for reading.

Addendum: This version is revised, I have changed some weapons and lights. Not much more.
