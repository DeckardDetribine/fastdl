Ancient Box

A map by hlife_hotdog

Thanks to:

Counter-Strike Source for most textures and some sounds
Half-Life 2 for other sounds

This was my first attempt at creating a nice looking "killbox" map as they are called. Basically one room for a handful of players to slug it out together in a violent and messy game of deathmatch.

Set in an ancient temple somewhere in the world (South America perhaps?), the room is dominated by a single opening in the roof letting in just enough light to illuminate the entire room. Some parts are crumbling but overall the temple is in fairly good condition but some areas of the outer area have suffered some flooding.
