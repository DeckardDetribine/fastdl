Gameplay Tips/Notes
-------------------
*The egon is placed behind an electric field.  You can turn down the generator in the middle of the level which
will deactivate the field.  You have 18 seconds to get to the egon before the shield goes up again.  
*You have to 'crouch jump' up to the little crates (jump, and then hold crouch)
*There are no secrets in this DM-level.  (secrets in DM-levels suck, imo)
*There is no Rocketlauncher and Hornetgun, but the gauss is there (you'll have to do some little crate-jumping, tho)
