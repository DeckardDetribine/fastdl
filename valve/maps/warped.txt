Additional Credits : This is my first ever map and i think that it is a very good attempt.
                     It is a fast paced match set on a few foating platforms in space with 
                     a few teleporters around the place.So have fun and frag all who oppose
                     Adam Smith for helping test the bot and informing
                     you. Email me with what you think of it.
