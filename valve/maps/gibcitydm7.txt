Special Notes   : Special credit goes to my wife Jacalyn, son WES, and

------Map Instructions-----------------------------------------------

Unzip the files in this archive.  Place the map, "gibcitydm7.bsp" in
your half-life/valve/maps directory.


------Additional Info------------------------------------------------

Map Construction/Layout :


                  All the DM starts have a weapon and ammo in front
                  of them.

                  The following entities are not included in this map
                  Gauss, Ergon, Hornetgun, and Snark.

                  There are no secrets in this map.

                  There are custom textures in this map.  These
                  textures were compiled into the .bsp and this
                  was done to facilitate an easier download from
                  a server during a game.

                  If you do not like this map or any of the entity
                  placements don't bother to tell me, just take the
                  .map and/or .wad files provided and make your own
                  version.
