HLDM Map by [Kasperg]YUGO

This map can be considered the sequel to "Guardian". It's not as 
big as Guardian but it's a brighter map and better in some aspects.
The textures are once again from "Tomb Raider 4" and a direct consequence
is that they blend together quite well. 
This map was done in 3 days as a break from my Source projects and the 
map for the upcoming HL1 compo, which I'm still working on.

Ingame features
---------------
I know the sun in the skybox is pointing in another direction. It looks
wrong but it doesnt affect gameplay at all :)
The egon is present, but there's almost no ammo for it. 
The Tau cannon is not present, mainly because of the advantage that hackers
usually had with this weapon in the past. Anyway, real players dont need
to rely on a particular weapon.
There is no longjump module in this map. It wouldnt really serve any purpose in this 
map.
