---Construction---
Editor Used		: World Craft 3.33
Compile Machine		: Gateway Desktop Computer equiped with a pentium 2 - 400 megahertz, 128 megs of RAM  	                               10 gig hard drive, and a NVIDIA Riva TNT video card
 
Base			: The map was actually inspired by death match arena's found on console games such as Turok: rage                                              wars. As far as texturing went, I mainly kept things to quake-like industrial textures.
 
Construction Time	              : Not very long, considering the size of the map. I estimate around 3-5 hours of total work. 
			 
---Notes---
 
 Well, right off, I was gunning for a fast paced death-match level that contained action elements of games like Unreal Tournament or Turok: Rage Wars. The map was also meant for small groups of people. In fact, some of the most enjoyable seniors through out my play testing, were one-on-one brawls with a friend and myself. I made ammo distribution relatively simple through out the map to make game play easier and more light-hearted. Texturing was not a big deal when I was making the map. I just used simple texture layering skills I have known for some time now. Lighting was another simple matter, but I feel it turned out nicely (only one light source was used: light environments AKA the sky). Finally, this is actually my very first released map. I hope it fairs well with the public, and makes gamers happy.
