This map was made under strong influense of HL deathmatches that
happened  during  my  vacation [aug 99]. It was the first time I 
played  this  FUNNY  game  in deathmatch. So, I decided to build 
this level. I've  played my deathmatches on Frenzy and Crossfire 
primarily, so  this  level  was inspired by them. I was strongly
enjoyed by camper/sniper/crossbow/357 game. It is very  fun when
you kills your friend in sniper mode when he shows his head from
various hidden places. High portion of tactics there is also fun.
Changing weapons according situation is very important in HL.

Yeah, one word  yet: this level was designed for 1-on-1 gameplay 
primarily. Cuz, you can play 3 or 4 ffa, but then there will not 
fun sniper/camper game, but meat processing plant.
