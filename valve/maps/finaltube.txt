Description		: This is maybe my last public Half-Life map.
			  It is an heavy reconstruction of my early planned
			  sewers map. It looks totally different now and has
			  only some Tubes left from the old map. It should
			  be heavy fun to play that baby and i spent some hard
			  weeks in the optimization of gameplay and structure
			  I think this map is something unique and has some elements
  			  from early Quake days in a few spots.

			  
Additional Credits to   : spacial thanks to [SO]Fritzman (fritzman@so-clan.de),
			  who spent much hours with me in the map to test gameplay.
			  And special thanks to Zoner, who made this kind of map
			  opossible with this techniques.
