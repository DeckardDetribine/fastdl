Map Description : almost 2 years ago i started mapping and with only 2 weeks 
experience i made my first submittable map (i thought anyways).
with so little experience i opted to do the entryway doom 2 map deja_vu
but sadly i failed. so as time went on i decided that i never really did the 
first version real justice considering how much i truly loved doom 2, so with 
some prompting from my fellow mappers i decided to totally remake deja_vu with
the extended experience i have obtained in the last 2 years and here i hope is 
the version you all have been impatiently waiting for.
this map has just enough of doom 2 to be entertaining but is vastly different 
from version 1. i hope you enjoy it just as much as i did creating it.
How Many Players: 8 to 12  but has 18 multi-playerstarts
