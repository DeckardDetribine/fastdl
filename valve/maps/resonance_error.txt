Details

I suppose it's only fitting that I made a map for my Mesa Collection as my last map. I'd never done many Xen-style maps, most of which can only be found in my mod Xen Crystal. I'd always had an attachment to lab areas like in early Black Mesa before you accident. Making the first 2 levels in Half-Life: Static Friction were the most fun and combining them with my skill of terrain by including a Xen theme as well seemed like a nice idea for my final Half-Life map. It's been almost 8 years since I started 
mapping for Half-Life. Back then, it was the biggest thing to me and I just couldn't put it down. So, after
 so many maps, it makes be sad to leave the old engine behind, but I know that I will have plenty of future mapping to do in new engines. So with that, I bid Goldsource farewell!

Enjoy
