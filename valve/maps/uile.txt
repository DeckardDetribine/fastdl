Description             : Small, FFA map. Although I consider Half-Life to be the best
			  single-player experience ever created, I've always been disappointed
			  with the standard deathmatch mode. After playing Quake2/3, I thought
			  about building a Half-Life level in which "movement" skills would be
			  more important then aiming and weapon-switching skills. The big
			  architectural themes of uile are curves and structure placement that
			  encourage jumping, gauss jumping and circle strafing. I've tried to
			  build a level that's fun to "run" around in rather than just fun to
			  frag in.

Additional Credits to   : A. Valve for making the greatest first-person perspective single-player
                             experience, ever. Sierra for supporting Valve and giving them the
                             necessary money.
                          B. The Half-Life Editing Resource Center for so much information (not

			  C. Fumigator, for his help in finding a solution to my untraceable
                             leak problem.
			  D. Zoner for his excellent compile tools. theAntiELVIS for HLCC,
			     MERZone Software for Q2 BeaVeR and Ryan "NEMESIS" Gregg for Batch
			     Compiler: three very well-made and intuitive compilation controllers.
			     Christopher Buecheler of Texture Studio for such a great collection
			     of textures.
			  E. J. for compiling the final beta version.
			  F. ID Software for a great engine, and for continuing the Quake *saga*
			  G. Friends who told me what they thought "worked" and wanted to see in
			     the map. The people on Rust Forums who spend their time helping
			     others.
