Installation Info	: Unzip the contents of this zip to your half-life folder and all the files

Map Description         : This map was created for the snarkpit mapping contest. The aim of the contest
			  was to create a level based on a piece of concept art. I chose to base a level
			  on an environment created by Sparth - the piece of art is included in the zip
			  file.

			  I went through many different maps in the life of this contest, before finally
			  coming to work on this one. Due to time constraints, I have unfortunately not
			  been able to complete the level, and so this beta version is my entry. Hopefully
			  I will be able to work on this project further, and so turn it into a proper
			  deathmatch map. Please note that due to the deadline I was unable to run VIS
			  fully. This is despite leaving it to run on netvis with 4 powerful computers for
			  20 hours...its not my fault, blame the rockwork!

Misc Author Info        : This is my tenth unique map release. I am a 19 year old currently studying
			  BSc Computer Games Technology at the University of Abertay in Dundee,
			  Scotland. Fingers crossed after getting this degree I will become a
			  fully fledged Level Designer working in the industry :) Outside of level
			  design I am a skateboarder, rollerblader, ice skater and snowboarder.
			  I listen to ska/punk/emo music and play a helluva lot of computer games! I
			  am also a member of a small student games development team based in Dundee.
