Description             : This is an upadated version of the original Scary_2, although it hasn't been a bug fixing mission.
			  The goal has been to make a level capable of bearing the weight of 4 to 6 players (scary_1 capacity).
			  Whilst adding a section I changed the mood to a late night setting, which works well in my opinion.
			  I stated at one point that the level would be updated with a water section, this turned out not to
			  the case. Such is life, and such is mapping. I never REALLY know how a map will develop .. one can
			  only try to visualise the finished product.

			  Anyway guys ... enjoy! I hope it makes for a decent battlefield.
