---------STORY----------------------------
The human invasion of Xen went all according to plan.  The Nihilanth is dead, thanks 
to Gordon Freeman, and the Xen forces are in disarray.  In order to control the border
world the military built multiple bases in strategic locations and began hunting down 
the remnants of the Xenian forces.  The G-Man, with both Xen and Freeman in his control, 
is confident that he has accomplished his mission. 
 
That is, until contact with one of the bases was lost.  Recon teams were sent in, but 
none returned.  Now you've been sent in to see what has caused this mess.  Hope you have
better luck than those who entered before you...


---------INFO----------------------------- 
This map has been quite the adventure.  I basically had to relearn everything about 
mapping and HLDM after a year layoff and then some.  The early versions of this map 
sucked, and each new one improved by leaps and bounds.  I'd still be working on this 
if there wasn't a deadline.  I'm not entirely happy with the outcome, but I'm going to 
build on the lessons from this one to make better maps when HL2 comes out.

I know there's some problems with the map, and that's because it didn't go through 
extensive testing before release in order to get it entered in the Snarkpit Mapping Contest 2004.
The number 1 complaint will probably be the lighting, and all I know is that I can see in there.
I'll make sure my next maps have better lighting.  In case you're wondering, the textures are
not mine.  I merged three wads together (shaderlab, than_industrial, meatpak) and then edited
some textures to meet my specifications.

All the weapons except the hivehand are in the map.  There is an egon, but it takes some 
effort to find and will cost you.
