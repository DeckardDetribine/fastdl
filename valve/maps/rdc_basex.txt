from a link on the Natural Selection (Half-Life 1 mod) forums.
Half-Life: Nightwatch - Textures
--------------------------------
nw.wad
nw_xeno.wad

Textures by:
Adam Foster, Henning Horstmann, Mohammad Alavi, Tomislav Spejic, and Tom DiLazaro. One additional texture by Cayle George. 

Includes additional textures created from bases by and/or originally authored by Randy Reddig and Kevin Roberts.

If you decompile rdc_basex and obtain the textures then please give credit to the list above for the nightwatch texture set because they rock
and those guys deserve the credit for the awesome textures!

I used some pictures and textures I found on the internet a while back. I have no way
to reference the original authors because the site where I downloaded them at is no longer available.

Had to rename skyname to "space2" to avoid conflict with other skybox.
