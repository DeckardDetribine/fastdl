			 appropriate files should be put into the appropriate 
			 directories.  Otherwise just copy the bsp file into your 
                         Half-Life\valve\maps directory.  Start the game normally
			 and the map should appear in the multiplayer game start 
			 setup... or join a server already running it.

*Construction*

Base			:My own DMCLINIC.bsp, modified according to specs by 
			 HolyGoat for action halflife, then ported to Half-Life.
Editor used		:Worldcraft 2.1
Build time		:One day.  Thats CPU time to compile... it actually took 
			 me months and months to create.
Known bugs		:None. But yell if you find some!
Textures		:Done by Rat-X (ratx@home.com) and myself!
Compile machine		:P2 300 w/64mb RAM,  32mb TNT2!  I love my TNT2.  If youre
	                 serious about mapping get an NVIDIA card, screw 3dfx.  It 
			 can hardware accelerated render in worldcraft :)
			 Thank goodness I kept the R_Speeds reasonable.  (Check em 
			 out!) Despite its size it runs quite smoothly on this 
			 lowly machine, due to a lot of careful func_wall-ing and 
			 vis blocking.
=================================================================================
Its after midnight in the eerie Kavorkian Medical Center
time to keep up the fine tradition of this place by 
blasting each other to bits!
=================================================================================

I think I may have repeatedly misspelled kavorkian.  It has nothing to do with 
clans of similar names.  Heh.  Any resemblance to people or places living or dead 
is purely a figment of your imagination. (lol)

*credits*
Credits go  to Valve, for the good engine, Axel and HolyGoat (from the action 
half-life development team) for the toilet flushing sounds, and Lord Dakushna 
(Dakushna@aol.com) for the toilet models!  Some of Valve's prefabs are used, but 
the unrecognisable furniture and beds and chairs and cash registers, etc are mine, 
except for the monitors.  Those were done by Revolver revolver@gpm98.freeserve.co.uk).  Thanks!
