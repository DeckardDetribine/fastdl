Description             : I started building the map just to get a feel of WorldCraft 2.0 but after a few days it
                          just took a shape of its own.  Inspiration came from a level in JK (the asteroid in MOTS) 
                          that I thought was really cool 'cause of all its little passageways.  Another thing that I 
                          really like in DMs are traps.  Thus the 3 that are in this DM.  The upper area was added
                          to give the map a sense of depth and more room for more players. Hope you enjoy.
