   ADDITIONAL INFO
----------------------
This is a kind of indoor storage facility with a good slime trap and many areas.
It has every weapon but i tried to make the beegun and egon a little harder to get.
This map was called felony but i changed it to misnomer thanks to testers advice,
I have worked on all the advice i recieved from the testers. 
The weapon placement may or may not be good...i had no server for another playtest.

I am ready to get on with Datablast and my website now.
Check out my site for a look at the beta shots of current projects.

I would also like to thank the man who playtested my first map and gave me a review....
that was fantastic and i liked the review but i had a system crash and lost it
and also lost a map i was making and i forget your name (sorry). You know who you are ...
just give me a mail so i can give you the thanks you deserve.
And also Richard Rice for his forklift prefab that i edited to my own design 
to save time building my own.

This map is is a final version and i dont think i will edit it any more
