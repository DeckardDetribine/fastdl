Thanks to everyone at Valve and Sierra. Thanks to Neil, Einar,
Magnus, Jack, and Paul at Black Widow Games.
Thanks to Barking Dog for Counter-Strike textures (used with
permission for "They Hunger").
  
=========================================================

* Installation *

You must have a full installation of Half-Life (Ver. 1.1.0.1) or higher.
Run hldm3.exe to install the files (default drive is "C", so change it if
you installed Half-Life to a different drive). They Hunger 2 is NOT required
to play this version of Thdm3, therefore the They Hunger weapons are not
available in this map and have been replaced with standard Half-Life issue.
