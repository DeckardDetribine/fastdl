Story			: Dawn breaks over the quarry.
			  You've arrived on a request from the
			  quarry's manager to investigate 
			  whisperings of worker unrest.
				  
			  Word of the incident at Black
			  Mesa has apparently spread, despite
			  the best efforts of the useless
			  military. 
         
                          As you pull up to the quarry,
			  the air feels charged with a sense
			  staleness. The normally noisy place
		 	  utters no sound. Removing the pistol
			  from your glove compartment, you step
		 	  from the car and approach the entry
			  tunnel.

			  As you step into the reddish light of
			  the entrance, the access door gives off
			  a low groan. Before you have a chance to
			  dive back under, the door falls shut with
			  a resounding clang.

			  A mechanical voice crackles over the P.A. 
 			  system
				  
  			  "This facility is under riot conditions.
			  Unknown toxin present in large quantities.
			  Seems to have adverse affect on judgement.
			  Toxin origin... Unknown"

Description		: A medium sized quarry/mine facility filled
			  with insane people and weapons. Do you
			  need more?
			
			  The orange stuff in the mines is harmless
			  in a physical sense. It's the reason for
			  all the bloodshed though.
			
			  In the office overlook
			  there's a power switch. Flipping it turns on
			  the machinery in the quarry, and the 
			  in the cave.
			  
			  You can make your way though the machinery
			  to a fairly nice weapon.
				  
			  Good luck and happy fragging!
