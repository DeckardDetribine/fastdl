	Due to the immence size of this level, I would tell the players b4 they join your server to get this from some Web page, and not to DL it from the server (this level is bigger in K's then Boot_Camp).  Theres no known bugs, but the r_speeds get high in one room, and possibly high in the sewer part.  And I would reccomend playin this in Hardware mode, bec/ software mode might act goofy, or not work at all. But other then that, theres nothing i can think of now, I hope you enjoy the map.  The number of start(spawn) spots is 15, but they are placed in strategic locations, and no 2 are close, so your gonna have to do some travellin to do some spawn killin.  Well i take that back, there's 2 spawn spots in the sewer that are fairly close.  I would reccomend this level be played with 8 or more people, due to its emmence size.  But if you feel like some hide n' go seek, then 2 ppl will suffice. :)

Special Thanx...
----------------
...The people who made WC.  And the [COOP] clan for excepting me into it.  I also like to dedicate this level to them too.  And Zoner for his kick A$$ toolz.  I've spent lots of countless hours sitting infront of my computer screen, workin on this level.  So far its my best one.  Id really like to thank my mother for puttin up w/ my horrible mood that i was in during the making of this level.  Its just so frustrating to complete the level and find this one stupid small detail thats out of place(Im a stickler for detail, as this map shows).  Then id have to compile it again...  Oh and a very special THANKS to DigiTec for compiling this level for me... Heres to you Kid.  You can check out our clan web page at www.spawn2000.com.
