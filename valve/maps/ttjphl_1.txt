About this Maps

For 2 years I've been making maps for HL/Mods and I've always had lots of fun. I have been hosted
at phl for nearly one year and that's the best thing that could have happened to me.
That's why I've decided to give something back to phl, HL so I made this three hl-style maps and
dedicated it to phl, HL and my friends who have helped me to become a better mapper =)

Special thanks to wolf the maker of rapidcore, lost village,...
He has reduced the r_speeds on ttjphl_1 and helped me with playtesting !!! Thanks Wolf !!!!!!!!!!!!!

A special thanks goes out to all the fantastic mappers who have made so many great HLDM Maps:

Apocalypso, Wolf, Scrary_1, Spider, Dave Waters,...

Description

ttjphl_1: Your normal hl map which sets in an outdoor/indoor blackmesa environment.
 
              The key to win this map are the grenades for the mp5 but be careful when you
              want to get them ;)
              This map plays really different from the other two maps. It's not one of this just run around
              and kill everybody maps. Be sure to play with a certain strategy in mind !!!!

              DEDICATED TO MICHAEL "FLASH" HINZ !


ttjphl_2: There are still people who are enjoying xen maps so this one sets in a xen environment.

              There are two teleporters use them !!!! On top of the xen structure you will find the 
              rocketlauncher be sure to get it. There is slime which helps you to regenerate your health
              be careful while standing in the slime ;)

              DEDICATED TO CONSTANTIN "TUMOR" SASSE !


ttjphl_3:This map features blackmesa lab style architecture and ambience.

             There are a lot different weapons in the map. The mp5 + grenades should be most useful so
             get them. The crowbow is useful for the long corridors. Please listens to sounds which will tell
             you on which level the enemy is moving.

             DEDICATED TO GUNNAR "CRAZY BORG" HOFFMANN !

Bot support ????????

At first I wanted to make waypoint files for all the maps so you can play them with the Jumbot.
Fortunately I tried the hldm bot PARABOT. It learns the maps from you so you dont need waypoints and
it plays the maps a lot better than the jumbot !!
You can download it here:

known issues:

ttjphl_3 has some spots where the r_speeds are a little bit high. Normal systems should handle them
well but slower systems may notice some slowdowns.
