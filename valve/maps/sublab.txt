Description             : Well, what can I say, it's my first one!
                          
                          As the title of the map may suggest, in a laboratory-complex deep underground.
                          The building is very high and quite open. At the very last moment I also
                          modelled a little outside erea with an entrance to the complex.

                          As far as gameplay is concerned I noticed that a lot of deathmatch maps are
                          for the most part horizontal ones. I tried to make a map that also forces you to look
                          up and down once in a while. As a result the map has quite a number of 
                          snipers-delight spots in it. Although you are never sure of who might be 
                          sneaking up behind you.
                          
                          The 3 doors all open manualy so you will be able to think of a plan befor
                          you rush into the room. The lifts all go up and down. They are triggered when
                          you stand in front of them (don't wait to long though because it's BOOM for you then).

                          While, in filesize, it's quite a large map it played rather well on the
                          machines I tested it on (from p200 + voodoo 1 to pII 350 with Ati Rage Pro). 
                          Also LAN playing was smooth enough for our daily fragfests. 

			  I hope you will enjoy playing it as much as I liked building it. And if you
                          do, please let me know.

Thanks to               : Bionic Bironic, Jeronimo, konteschopper, dualis, Doomy, Lamer deluxe, Kort Jackje,
                          the sniper (you know who you are) and all the other guys at Davilex who played 
                          with me on my map and in the meantime made some usefull remarks.

                          And let's not forget the guys from Valve for making a great game.
