---Notes---
 This is my second release, the first being a rather small map entitled Enemy, and I am 
fairly pleased with the way it turned out.  All the weapons except the hornet gun and the
egon are present, and you'll notice there is only one MP5; you will have to venture into 
the trap room to get it - make sure there is noone waiting :) Ordinarily I am no fan of traps, 
as I find they just as often hinder gameplay as enhance it, but the industrial-like environment
of Dragon seemed well suited, particularly with all the molten metal.

Please!! E-mail me with any comments on the level, praise or criticism.
Any feedback is much appreciated.


---Special thanks---
Thanks first to Valve for the great game.
Thanks to B-nutz and my fellow members of the IZ clan for the feedback, and to all who 
downloaded my map!
