---Notes---
This map was originally made for counter-strike but I have converted it to go with both 
counter-strike and HLDM. You can get the CS version on my website.
The map comes with custom textures, sky map and a sound. Just extract teh zip to you valve 
directory and it will install the files to the appropritate directories.

E-mail me with any comments on the level, praise or criticism.
Any feedback is much appreciated.
