------Additional Info, Tips, and Notes-------------------------------

Actually the first map I did when starting mapping was basement; it was pretty awful though and never released! I basically went back and stole a couple things from the old map and did a new version that was more what I wanted it to be. That was ahl_gebasement... then I went back AGAIN and started to do a NEWER version for HLDM and AHL. That is what you are playing right now!

Basically, what I wanted to do was take a very simple map and make it pretty and polished. It was also sort of a practice excercise for me in lighting and texturing. The end result is a pretty map that's still very low in polies (under 400).
