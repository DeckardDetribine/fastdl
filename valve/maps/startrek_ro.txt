-----   Map Description   -----

The U.S.S. Atlantis is a Starfleet deep space science vessel that has been taken over by an 
unknown group of people who are fighting for control of the ship.  

This map is packed to the Half-Life engine's limits with all sorts of interactive features.  
You'll be clicking for days before you figure everything out.  The most amazing thing is 
that its all just one file, the BSP.

-----   Cool Map Features   -----

8.  Reactivating shield inside Jefferies tubes with weapons in them frags person

9.  Shuttle bay snark trap (for fraging those players that just won't get sucked out 
into space (stop under shuttlecraft ramp) or just to see them dart around the shuttle 
bay.

Interactive Stuff

1.  Press "e" on every panel/button - 80% do something (ranging from beeps to

and rotating map "movie" credits.

…and more.  Go take a look around and don't forget to use the "use" key.


-----   Known Issues   -----

1.  LAN Games:  In LAN mode the throwable items (bag bombs, snarks, grenades, etc.) for 
some reason seem not to respawn.  The map is very complex and seems to eat up more 
memory than the HL-Client LAN based server can handle as far as we can tell at this 
point (this only effects you if you're not running a dedicated HLDS server and trying to 
have the Half-Life client host the map).  If you have any information regarding this 
strangeness, e-mail us.  If a way for it to work properly in LAN mode is brought to our 
attention, we will release a second version of this map that fixes the problem.  This map 
does not have the problem mentioned above when hosted by a dedicated HLDS server 
under Windows 2000 or RedHat Linux.

2.  Turbo Lift:  After release, we discovered that the Turbo Lift sometimes snags players 
when a server lags causing them to get caught.  This seems to be a bug in Half-Life itself.  
This problem never happened during extensive QA testing, but if we discover a fix, we'll 
release a second version of this map.
