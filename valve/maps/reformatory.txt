Other Info

This is my 3rd released map for Half-Life. It's somewhat of a
departure from my previous two maps which were aimed at being 
suitable for server rotation maps. This one is geared towards 
smaller faster paced games, namely LANs. Orignally when I was 
designing the map I did not intend on having the roofs accessable, 
I had assumed that the r_speeds up there would be too unbearable.
But much to my liking, after a little bit of play testing I found
that for the most part the r_speeds were passable (especially for
a LAN game) and it added another dimension to the gameplay that 
helped the level seem much bigger.

The style of this map is based much more on the "Valve" look,
I figured i should give it a shot since a lot of people really
like the more military/compound type feeling maps. The map is 
small enough that it makes for a slower paced (but quite fun,
right BC?) one-on-one, but it's also large enough for a fast
paced six person free-for-all. More than six and the weapons
would begin to run a little too thin.
