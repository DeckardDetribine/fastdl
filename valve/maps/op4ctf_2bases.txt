sh_2bases (1.2)

by TheCoolGman

-----------------------
Info

2bases is a simple Black Mesa like map for Scientist Hunt,
Opposing Force, and Team Fortress Classic. It's a small map
fit for 6 players or more and takes place at two pumpstations
in some remote area far out in the desert.

-----------------------
Fun Facts

This map took about four days.

1.0 - Two days
1.1 - One day
1.2 - Four days(OP4CTF issues took up most of the time)

Originally was going to be more inventive with the killing
contraptions, such as crushers.

This map was going to be more like 2Fort, and was inspired
by sciblood. I hated that map but wanted to do something
similar.

Author's Notes

This is the final release. This started off as a little idea
for a Scientist Hunt map that I started to create in late May.
Now it's an OP4 and TFC map as well! So now I've gotten to 
this point I think I'm pretty happy with this release. 
So please enjoy!
