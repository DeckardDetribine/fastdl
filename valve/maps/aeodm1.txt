Description		: The map is a small to medium sized storage complex ideal for 2-8 players
			  (12 respawn points) featuring large and small areas.  It's easily remembered and not one
			  of these large dull, boring maps like many included with the game.
			  Ideal for mad crazed fragging and the like.

			  The map offers a wide range of player techniques from running around, to camping as well
			  as being a good map to setup explosives.

			  As well as making the map look intresting , much attention has been put towards how the map
			  sounds like when played.  Therefore, in vital parts of the map they may be different floor
			  surfaces giving the diferent sounding footsteps.  This becomes very useful in duel play
			  when much of the sounds give a clue to where the opponent is.

			  As for weapons layout, many of them have been put in strategic locations. For example, the
			  rocket launcher has been placed in a vunerable position to deter weapon camping.  The
			  guass gun too, requires one of two methods in order to retrieve it.  As for other equipment, 
			  theres one or two surprising locations.

			  All weapons included except hornet gun and egon gun which would not suit the map
			  and their both boring anyway.

Other maps by me	: Nope, this is my first map.

*Play Information*

Playtested on		: AMDK6-2 300, 64 meg and a Monster 12 meg Voodoo 2
			  and AMDK6 200, 64 meg and a 4 meg voodoo1 over a LAN.
			  Both easily zipped along at a healthy rate.

Single Player		: Erm...nope.  Unless you want to take in the breath taking architecture
			  with out having the pleasure of spreading someone's guts across it.

Multiplayer		: Oh yes indeedy.

Team Play		: Yes i suppose.

*Construction*

Base			: From Scratch
Editor used		: Worldcraft 2.0
Bugs			: Hell no.

Build Time		: A phrase that ryhmes with 'plucking pages' springs to mind.  Mainly because
			  until i started this groovy map I had no knowledge of how to use worldcraft,
			  at all.  So i went back and re-did many of the rooms as I learnt new things.

Compiled on		: AMDK6-2 300, 64 meg and a Monster 12 meg Voodoo 2
