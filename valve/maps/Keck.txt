Description             : An alien ship crashed into the side of a mountain
                          then some people showed up and they all started
                          killing each other with the guns and ammo lying
                          around for no reason what so ever.

* Author's Comments *

This one took me a LONG time so go have some fun at my expense. Questions,
and comments are welcome, you can contact me at

I believe the reason it crashes in software mode is because of the number
of entities I use. However I'm not enirly sure truth be told. Again please
do not run it in software mode.
