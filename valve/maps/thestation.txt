Title                   : The Station
Filename                : thestation.bsp
Author                  : Cathode[MoB]
Description             : A supply/train station, it's dark (Mabey too).
			  And for some reason or another you 
			  feel like finding people and killing them. Six
			  or more people will do, and there's no
			  Egon, even the most powerful weapon in the map
			  is hard to get too. I picked the 7th track for
			  the CD, is it just me or are usually the best
			  songs on CD's the 7th track? Anyway this is my
			  first map so comments/critism is welcome. Uhh
			  I want to start a clan for HL [MoB] 
                          [Money over Bitches], interested email me (sorry
			  for the plug).

Special Thanks to       : TRiLoGY, Marnello22, PeeperZ,

			  and iD for the FPS genre

To play this level, extract the file "thestation.bsp" into
your sierra\half-life\valve\maps directory and then start the game.
Start a deathmatch server and type "map thestation" or "changelevel
thestation" in the console. To test it out in single player mode
start Halflife with hl.exe -console -toconsole -dev. This enables
