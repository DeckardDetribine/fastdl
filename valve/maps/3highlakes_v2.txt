CHANGES:
This was a special request.  It's my 3 High Lakes map minus the waterfalls and a lot less
water.  I guess r_speeds (poly count) was good enough, but all the water gave some video
cards fits and slowed things down.  This should be better.  Also, I removed both blue guns
(egon weapons), since they are just too powerful.  


ABOUT THE MAP:
It is a pretty straight-forward deathmatch map.  This is my first attempt at making a map.
No moving parts such as doors/elevators/conveyor belts/etc...  No buttons to push.  If I
make another map I will use some `smoke and mirrors', increase the size, and increase the
complexity of it.

This was a learning experience.  I found some real short-comings in WorldCraft v2.1 and
thought it would be easier.  I now truly appreciate some of the great maps I've played,
knowing just a little of what is involved.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
 - I could not get some mountain textures to look right, so I finally gave up on that part
   of it.
 - As I understand it, the game engine uses your CPU to draw the polygons and there are some
   occasional white dots in some mountain walls due to the angular shapes I made caused by
   the FPU (Floating Point Unit) rounding off numbers.
 - The r_speeds average around 550-650 in most places, so internet play on phone modems with
   slow systems may lag a bit.  As far as LAN play, or DSL/ADSL/Cable/etc. internet play,
   hopefully this map should rock...

** PLAY INFORMATION **

SINGLE PLAYER:
You can run through it to get familiar with the layout, etc.

MULTIPLAYER:
6-16 players would probably work out fine.

DESCRIPTION:
Centered around 3 lakes set high up in the mountains, during a drought.

PLAYING:
With:
 - 18 DM respawn points.
 - Atleast 2 of each kind of weapon, except for the egon weapon.
 - Plenty of weapons, ammo, heath, and HEV recharges scattered throughout.
 - Several ways to access just about any point in the map.
 - All chain-link fences are climbable.
 - Access to all but the highest mountain tops.
 - The 3 trees are climbable (only from 1 side) and you can hide in them.

 Pitfalls...
 - Falling off the to outside of any mountain brings certain death.

** LAST NOTES **
I hope you like and play this map.  There was no central theme to this map, except for some
fun blood-letting.

The internet abounds with sorry-ass critics intent on bringing everyone else down with their
rantings (personal opinions).  I am not asking for a critique, and won't receive one.  I
am not leaving an e-mail address.
