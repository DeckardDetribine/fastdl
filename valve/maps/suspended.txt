This map is my first experience in voluntarily displaying more than 900 wpolys.
The map was born out of a sketch I did for a shopping mall.
The layout is made of a big arena-type area with some sub-rooms that connect the 
different height levels of the map. In playtesting, it was fun even with bots.
Texturing, although objectively blurry and simple, is an important aspect of the map. 
The main color scheme follows a set of rules: the greyish concrete is used for wall surfaces. 
The blueish one is used as railings would. The yellowish concrete is used in vertical 
supports. The rest of the beams, thinner supports and trims are made of red, orange or 
yellow materials. The floor is either solid concrete or covered with orangish sand. If 
this was a real place, the sand would feel moist and cold, as well as most of the walls.

This map is a possible candidate for a Source conversion.
