Description		: Heavy Pole is a big map for up to 16 players.
			  I think less than 4 player will not have very much
			  fun on this big map. Four players are enough anyway
			  to have really fun, because the map has overall a 
			  excellent conectivity to reach every area in the map
			  imidiatly from more than one way. this map as
			  four big areas; a big area with one house with an 
			  elevator inside, one big room with a wide window and
			  shotgun and 9mmAR inside, a little sewer-system in the
			  center of the map and another big area with one building
			  and two massive towers. Some fans are added around the
			  map, to give some structures more "live".
			  I construceted many ladders at containers or walls,
			  to give players more ability to reach upper areas.
			  For some areas you need the gauss-cannon to reach them.
			  The place, where you can pick up the gauss-cannon, has
			  a little alarm-system. When somebody crouches to the
  			  gauss, an alarmsound and a female voice-message will
			  sound up. Also the lights on one of the towers will start
 			  rotating for a visual alarm-effect. Also i have added some 
			  buttons to activate doors to hidden places. I have
			  put all my knowledge about the HL-enginge into this 
			  map to hold up the gamespeed. The base-construction is
			  overall not anti-lag styled, but i have reduced wpoly
			  as hard i could. The result is a map, with many open
			  areas like in boot_camp or gasworks with the
			  speed-parameters of maps like outcry...
			  
Additional Credits to   : spacial thanks to Jameson (lvj@gmx.de) for
			  beta-testing this map and many players of
			  [MoV] - Masters of Violance - (www.mov-clan.de)
                          for Internet and LAN-Testing :). Without the help
			  of this people, Heavy Pole has never reached the high
			  qualitiy :) 
			  I hope all players around the net can presage, what
			  a hard work and lot of time was spent in this one.
			  Evrey mapper around, knows what i am talking bout ;)
