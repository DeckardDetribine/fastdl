.::  Map Description  ::.

In my search for the perfect textures for some of my upcoming projects, I
found Sock's excellent Tech texture set. Inspired, I downloaded them, converted
them all to .wad format, and started building. This is the result.

I wouldn't say this map quite meets my level of achievement in Valor or Repair
Bay 4, but it's by no means a bad map in my opinion. I lost inspiration somewhat
late in development, and started a new project, Defiance, based upon the same texture
set but a new architectural outlook. However, the playtest with 4 and 5 were fun (if
not a bit sparse), and the general reaction when I announced that I was not planning
on releasing this map was one of general disappointment; while the map is by no means
my best, it still is of releasible quality. For this reason it's in your hands now.

Consider it a teaser for Defiance. :)
