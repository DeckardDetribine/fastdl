Description             : Tauamid is a vertical map, featuring a combination of open and enclosed areas.

			This map consists of rustic buildings on the surface. Under that are catwalks and cliffs hanging over a group of tunnels. These overlook and allow access to the pyramid arena at the bottom of the level. The pyramid will teleport a player right to the top of the level.

			There is no real backstory here as I mainly wanted to make a fun little map. If there has to be a backstory or theme, imagine some kind of cross between Stargate and the X-Files with some xenoarcheologists finding this alien pyramid underground. They hasily build a secret research base under the adobe village. Everyone soon goes nuts before they get any research done and the killing begins. 

			It's called Tauamid because I like the tau gun and it's right next to the pyramid.

			Speeds seem good even on our sad computers.
