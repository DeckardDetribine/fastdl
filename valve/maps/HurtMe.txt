* Description *

A very small deathmatch map (not as small as my last one) for 2-4 players.
Every weapon except the egon is included, some of the weapon are
hard to find (and get). I will give you some tips.

To get the RPG you will need to get the longjump or gauss, with the
gauss you can easily jump high enough to reach the RPG, which is in top
of a building in the largest outdoor area. If you prefer to use the longjump
jump on the wooden crates nearby the RPG.
You have to jump and when your feet are loose from the ground press duck,
this way you can jump higher. And on top of the crates you'll find the longjump
some snarks and even crossbow ammo. With the longjump you can jump easily to the
RPG.

If you want the crossbow you will have to gauss-jump to the top of the billboard
in the small outdoor area.

If you think it's still impossible to get the weapons you have to play the Hazard
Course again. Or just commit suicide and prey you respawn next to the RPG or crossbow.

By the way, does anyone reads those files ?
