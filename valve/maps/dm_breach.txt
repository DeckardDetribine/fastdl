DM_BREACH

HLDM MAP FOR TWHL COMPO 19

Jax's comeback into HL mapping after around 1 & 1/2 years?

Zip include dm_breach.bsp

Thanks to Ant for playtesting at the last second.

Congratulations to myself for actaully getting this in on time
even if I had to strive to make it get like it is in time 
(map was only around 70% done at the last day or so).

Map includes custom textures.
Map should run without error.
Map has over 8 spawn points.

Thanks, Jax
