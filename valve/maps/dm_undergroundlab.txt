This is my entry for the seconds "Map from layout" compo at TWHL.
Its a HLDM map for Half-Life.

I don't expect to win this at all because i made a fatal mistake near the end, forcing me to make an alternative path not shown on the layout picture, i hope this isn't a big issue for the judges.

This map features some of my best vertex manipulation work. It took me 3 days to map the cave part using tetrahedrons.


ENJOY THE MAP!
