Streetlevel(Remake) 1.01

-----------------------
Info

Streetlevel was my first released map, and as always my worst. I unleashed this bug fest on April 2nd, 2011. Despite the flaws, it was well received. I was contemplating whether or not to remake Streetlevel. I finally came to the conclusion that it was needed. There are many new additions visually and gameplay wise. I added back a few sections and items that were originally scrapped from the first(due to the limits I hit). After about 4 months of work I hope you enjoy Streetlevel!

Story

The year is 1999 in the downtown slums of an old city. Earlier that day there were a few car wrecks and other various concerns that have left this part of town closed off. No one is here, all this landscape just yours for the taking. Though others have the same desire to steal as much goods as you, think you are just going to let them walk away with all that loot?
