DESCRIPTION   
	
		Yes, its been a couple of years since I released a Half-Life 
	map...I did manage to become a much better mapper in the mean time.  
	I took it upon myself to correct all of the mistakes I made in Torque 
	and to make a high quality map, both visually and play-wise.  After 
	hours of hard work and the total abandoning of about five almost 
	complete maps, I finally made a map I was happy with.  	
		This is a medium-sized, fast-paced map that's fun for the 
	whole family.  There are six main areas interconnected with hallways 
	and teleporters.  All of the weapons except for snarks hornetgun are 
	included.  Getting the egon is possible, but don't be cursing at me for 
	tricking you to go after it.  I made sure that the weapons are balanced, 
	and that the ammo placement forces people to move around if they want 
	the most out of the more powerful ones like the gauss and rpg.  In my 
	opinion, this kind of weapon/ammo placement provides the best 
	deathmatch experience.  ;)   There is almost nowhere to hide and camp, 
	so those of you who like that sort of thing better be prepared to lose.   
	Basically I created a map that I would like to play.  
		Frankly, I'm pretty happy with how this map turned out.  I 
	hope you will enjoy playing it as I did building it.
