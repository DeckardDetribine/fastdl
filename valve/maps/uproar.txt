Description         : Four days of mapping plus several days of playtesting and tweaking
                      produced this - Uproar, my third map.

                      Uproar is basically four arenas that are connected together. I have
                      really tried to emphasize connectivity in this map, so when you're
                      playing you should never have to follow a linear path or run into a
                      dead end. Because most of the arenas are right next to each other and
                      there aren't hallways splitting them up, r_speeds are higher than I
                      wanted. I tried lots of methods to lower them, but they weren't very
                      effective.
                      
                      This was a lot different than my previous two maps. Everything just
                      came together real well, and I never had to spend days thinking up an
                      idea for one room. I really enjoyed putting it together, and hopefully
                      you can get some enjoyment from playing it.

Jumbot Waypoint     : I've included a JRF file so you can play Uproar with Jumbots. It was
                      made by Scary_Jeff. Check out his site for maps and other JRFs at
