- My second map! It's fun! It's speedy! If you're a weakling you'd better get the hell out of here! Again, it's a rather small map, but because i have placed a reasonable amount of healthkits in the map, it's possible to add maybe a few more... Let's say up to seven. But you must realise, you'd have carnage on your hands. 
- Unlike my first map (G0b-forsaken) the r_speeds only go over 600 in one area, and then it's still only about 630. You'd have to do your best to find it though, one pixel off and it's 580 again. A definite speed improvement over my first map, hence the name.
