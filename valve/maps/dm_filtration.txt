| SUMMARY:							|
|								|
| As one of the main intake pumps for the filtration systems of	|
| Environment Processing, this section of the facility never 	|
| sleeps. The millions of gallons of water consumed by the	|
| Tycho Complex all pass through here at one point or another.	|
|								|
| It's your job to make those waters run red.			|
