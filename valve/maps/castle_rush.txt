Description		: In this map you can enter two castles with
			  differnt "look" and gameplay. Under the
 			  castles you can walk through the underground
			  cellar and make your way from one castle
			  to the other. In evry castle you can find 
			  powergenerators. Evra Powergenerator has a
			  little switch. In the smaller castle you
			  can switch down the ordenary lights in the
			  castle (not in the cellar) and the emergancy
			  lights (green) will lit up the castle interieur.
			  In the big castle the generator switch can be used

			  each castle. Through this shafts you can jump
			  down in the hallways of the castlecellars...

		::: ADDITIONAL INFO :::
================================================================

I have build this map, because the most DM-maps created till today
are looking like laboratorys modern structures but not medieval...
This castles are looking very medieval and i thought i may be a
good contrast and alternative playground for multiplayersessions.
