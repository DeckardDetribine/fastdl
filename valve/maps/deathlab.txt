First the description. Does anyone really care about compile times?

Obvioulsy this is a lab type environment duh?
This lab does testing with lasers and also has Xeno plants for observation purposes.
The Xeno plants were brought back from a far away planet...............
Some of these plants are dangerous and they are clearly marked so watch out.
There are a few tricks/traps that a player can get into, lasers, snarks and electricity.
There is also one hidden elevator that leads to the rocket launcher. There isn't a guass or
egon/gluon, whatever u call it, in this level, they would be far too effective.

This level was designed with fast game play in mind. You should not have any trouble finding a weapon
or killing/gettin killed in this level. There is quite a bit of health and armor to go around as well as weapons and ammo.
There are also other things that players have to look out for as they battle, lasers and Xeno tree.
This level should be a blood bath with some strategy as well, I hope.
There are some parts I had to cut back on details due to r_speeds, so some of this level isn't as pretty as I had wanted to be. :-(

My last level, Spider, was built more for some sniping and strategy with larger areas. This one has a number of smaller rooms
along with some larger ones.

I think this will be my last level for a while, I have other maps thingys goin on, unless you guys email me and tell me this
level ROCKS then I will have to build another :-). Hint Hint.............

I have recieved a number of people asking for help on map making. I am by NO means an EXPERT, that is Steve the bum :-), but
I am happy to help out any way I can and I will give sample rmf files as well, this stuff can be very frustrating, so drop a line if ya want.

Be sure to look for the button near the small laser and watch out for the health charger :-) MEAN.
Later
Jeff
