Title                   : Suicide Express
Filename                : s-xpress.BSP

Description             : Am I the only one who like trains? Well,
			  if not, you might become happy with this 
			  large map. It features two trains, running 
			  different tracks. There are wide open spaces 
			  for our snipers, small corridors for the 
			  fragfest-friends and dark corners where the 
			  anxious ones can hide...and don't forget to 
		          USE the trains (especially to get the real 
			  cool stuff). 

Special Thanks to       : Valve for creating Halflife (greatest game
			  ever!),
			  Jan Graeber aka 'Mr.Eddy' for beta-testing,
			  Jon Mcllwaine for the bloody 'reviews' of 
			  my maps,
			  all the cool guys at Radium (it rocks) and
			  finally all the people who helped me with 
			  their knowledge at Wavelength!

Construction

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor used             : Worldcraft v2.0
Known Bugs              : Not a 'bug', but something that could suck
			  is the low sky. When climbing on higher
			  buildings, you might touch the sky with your
			  head. Not very cool, but it had to be done
			  for a better performance, 'cause the
			  r_speeds are very critical at some places in
			  the outdoor-area anyhow.

Build Time              : 6 weeks

================================================================

Designer's Notes

As mentioned above, the r_speeds are very high (about 1200) in some 
places. In the outdoor-area my P-166/V1 went into some trouble. The
underground-area is fine, so people with low end-systems will probably
spend most of their time deep in the dungeons ;).
With a PII/V2 or higher there are no problems.
People, playing in software mode will see the sky and maybe the trains 
disappearing to the 4th dimension in critical areas. 
No tears please, you've been warned ;)

Installation

To play this level, extract the file "s-xpress.BSP" into
your sierra\half-life\valve\maps directory and then start the game.
Start a deathmatch server and type "map s-xpress" or "changelevel
s-xpress" in the console. To test it out in single player mode
start Halflife with hl.exe -console -toconsole -dev. This enables
you to try some stuff using the cheat codes.
