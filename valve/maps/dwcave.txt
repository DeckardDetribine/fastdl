OK, in places this level does have some shockingly high r_speeds, so on slower computers it may be verging on unplayablity. I definately wouldn't play this level in software, but then I wouldn't play anything in software these days, especially not HL.

This level has not been tested over the internet, because I have a very bad connection down here in the sticks, and I don't want to be landed with a massive 'phone bill.

ANY feedback of any kind is gratefully, even tearfully, recieved. Please?
