Special Notes   : Special credit goes to my wife Jacalyn, son WES, and
                  daughter JES for putting up with a 40+ obsessive map
                  maker.

                : I have included the .map and .wad files in an effort
                  to help and encourage other authors.  Use all or part

------Additional Info------------------------------------------------

Map Construction/Layout :


                  All the DM starts have a weapon and ammo in front
                  of them.

                  The following entities are not included in this map
                  Gauss, Hornetgun, and Snark.

                  The generator was a heavily modified prefab authored
                  by AmranX.

                  The street light was a heavily modified prefab authored
                  by iKKe[BAR]. 

                  There are no secrets in this map.

                  There are custom textures in this map.  These
                  textures were compiled into the .bsp and this
                  was done to facilitate an easier download from
                  a server during a game.

                  If you do not like this map or any of the entity
                  placements don't bother to tell me, just take the
                  .map and/or .wad files provided and make your own
                  version.
