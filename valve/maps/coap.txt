* Description *

 My first HL-level.  Some kinda abandonned storage facility.  A bit too big for 
 1on1, but a 4+ FFA should do.  All the weapons are there, except the hornet.
 There is a sniper/camping-spot for the Crossbow-dudes.
 There are also some really small hallways, i think you  should be able to set up 
 some nice traps with trips 'n satchels there.
