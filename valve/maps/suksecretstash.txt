Map Description         : its a city map but its more of a novelty map because of all the secrets
                          i dont care for secrets too much but they seem to be popular.the connectivity is 
                          great if you know all the secrets.but if not it should be fine
                          r_speeds are a little higher than most maps but no one had problems
                          with their machines.they normally dont go above 750 but i didnt check the whole map.
                          and that was up in the higher areas
