LEVEL DESCRIPTION
=================
This map is my second entry for the Snarpit (www.snarkpit.com) 'themed' mapping competition. The theme I chose for this map was a limit of colours (3 solid colours used throughout), with any detail being made solely from brushwork. It makes for a different and interesting appearance and i'm quite pleased with the outcome. Because of this however, it can be a little hard to navigate round at times. I was partly influenced by the video for Mad Capsule Market's song Pulse which I have named the map after.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
There's only three colours in the map...I know! It was deliberately built this way ;)
