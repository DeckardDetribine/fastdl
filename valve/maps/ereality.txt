Escape Reality - For HalfLife (Deathmatch)
by Lloyd Morris



Design Philosophy: 	After Aftershok I decided to take on a new 
			design philosophy. I have tried to move away from 
			concrete bunkers / outposts and so I've decided
			to design something a little different.

Description: 	 Setting- 9:47AM  17/3/2433

		 This is a large level with some airy locations for about
		 10 players (14 starting locations).
		 The setting is of a building with some strange architecture. 
		 My aim was to create a large level yet keep architecture interesting.
		 Generally dual tone texturing - dark/light - was employed as
		 multi-coloured textures wouldn't have gone with the
		 surroundings. In this instance I let the lighting
		 itself add the necessary colour.
		 This time around I have taken great care in terms of the
		 connectivity of this map (all rooms have multiple exits) to
		 reduce camping.
		 All weapons except the Hive-Hand are present, but the more powerful ones
		 (RPG, EGON, GAUSS) are more difficult or dangerous to reach.
============================================================================================

 		The average wpoly count on the map is 239 but in certain places where the
		wpolys get a little high the epolys have been kept to a minimum. In order 
		to cut epoly counts, I have used the weaponbox entities. This also cuts
		down on the total entity count for the map - again this should increase 
		the speed - and at the same time increased the number of weapons / ammo.
		Epoly counts should not pass much over 1000.
		_____________________________________________________________
		Explanation of how to get some of the weapons:

		- To get the EGON which is situated in the GAS CHAMBER you must risk
		the POT LUCK teleporter in the LOW GRAVITY room. This has four
		destinations which change every 15 seconds. You will lose a small
		amount of life in the GAS CHAMBER but after a couple of seconds you will
		be teleported back to the LOW GRAVITY room.

		- To get the GAUSS which is situated in the BEAM TRAP room you must first
		press the green button marked SAFETY HOOD which is situated up the small
		flight of stairs at the top of the large 3 layered open room with 2 pool
		tunnels at the bottom. Press the keypad which emerges and the camera will
		switch for one second to a view of the safety hood cutting off the beams.
		You then have a few seconds (it can be done:) to retrieve the GAUSS before
		the hood retracts.

		- To get the RPG in the SEMICIRCULAR TUNNEL simply strafe towards the
		small opening to the right just after the fan starts to suck you in. You
		should just be able to grab the weapon and reach safety.
		_____________________________________________________________
	- Purpose of the circular glassy hovering things (CGHT):

	In the BOTTOMLESS POOL (which by the way is where the CROSSBOW is found)
	there is a lever. Under the pool there are two of these CGHTs. Each is a teleport
	leading to another one, e.g. to the one in the LOW GRAVITY room. The lever in the
	pool changes the destination of both the CGHTs. The only CGHTs which teleport you
	anywhere are the ones under the pool. If you jump through any of the others you
	will hear a sound but nothing else will happen as these are destinations.

	- Note that the central arched tree type structure is climbable at the
	edges as the arrows which appear as you get close indicate.

	- Note also that in the low gravity room where walkways have square holes
	in them, jumping height is greatly increased.

Base: 		New level from scratch.
Editor Used:	Worldcraft 2.0
Known Bugs:	None, but due to the large number of entities present, in
		single player test runs if you use the /impulse 101 cheat
		for 'all weapons' you should press the ` to close the console 
		between each application of this cheat.
		In other words press ` then type /impulse 101 <enter> then ` and
		` again and the up cursor and continue to get full weapons.
