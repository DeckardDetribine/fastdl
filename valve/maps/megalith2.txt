Installation Info:
------------------
Unzip all of the files to your half-life directory. The files will automatically be put in the correct subdirectories.

Please note:
------------
This map slightly exceeds the default texture maximum of 4 mb. This may cause some problems on some old video cards.

This map is detailed and therefore may run slowly on older computers (ie: less than 400 mhz).

Permissions:
------------
You may do pretty much anything you want with this map as long as you abide by 2 rules:

1: You may not sell any part of this map in any form unless you obtain permission from me.
2: I must be listed in the credits of anything that uses any part of this map.

That said, i am pretty cool about people using my work as a base and/or using parts
of my maps in their maps. If you have reason to want the source files to this map, you can contact me explaining your reasons, and the chances are that i will give you the source files you requested.
