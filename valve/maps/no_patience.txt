------Personal Thoughts----------------------------------------------
Before I began this map I had unofficially retired, with the lack of newness to a tired game Halflife had lost its appeal to most of the world and for this I am saddened, BUT with the advent of new and more powerful machines certain mappers started to produce maps of astounding quality, BUT a few of these mappers drifted away from the old standards of quality maps with lower r_speeds, so I set out to prove that you can make a very detailed map and retain r_speeds of less than the set standard of 800 and thanx to some very helpful companions I did just that. this map is dedicated to all the mappers out there, past and present, who will take the time to maintain lower r_speeds and still produce high quality.
