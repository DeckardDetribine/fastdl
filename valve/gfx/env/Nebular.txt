Skybox by Justin Fisher 


This Skybox comes from "Gunmetal" by Mad Genius Software, and has been converted 
for Quake III Arena. Textures copyright 1998, Justin Fisher. 

You may include these textures with your levels, provided that they are credited to 
Justin Fisher (the textures, not the levels :). However, the textures may not be 
used in commercial products or for commercial purposes without permission. You may 
distribute these textures as level building assets, but must include this file.


ABOUT:
Overhead sun (well, more like extra-bright star) and nearby nebula spanning almost 
180 degrees of the view. Well suited to space maps.

Panels are 256x256, and you may notice that three of the panels use the same image 
(they depict only stars). In Q3A however, I don't know of a way to get it to use 
the same image on multiple sides, so there are 3 identical panels used here.
In other words, the RAM cost of this sky could be greatly reduced if there is a way
to tell the engine to use the same texture for three of the panels, but currently 
I'm doing it the crude way :-)

Enjoy your new world.
