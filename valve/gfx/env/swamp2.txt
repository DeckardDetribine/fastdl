this is set for both software and GL users.


how to use the damned files:
---------------------------------------------------------

unzip all this stuff (except the text, woops, too late...  it's ok...) to:

	/Quake2/baseq2/env/

Start Quake 2.
Get in the game and open a console with the ~ key (ma tilda) and type in:

	sky swamp2

get rid of the console and go to a window or go outside (in quake2 that is, not for real...)  check out the sky, it should be different.  It isn't?  Uh oh, you messed up, 'cause it worked here.  deja-vu on the read again huh?



what you can do with this stuff:
---------------------------------------------------------

abuse it, lose it, cheat on it, ask for it back, whatever your mind can come up with.  All I ask is that if this is used for a TC/PC/Mission Pak/or other form of Quake2 thing, let me know and give me a credit line for it.  it would really make me happy to see that.  If you use it and make money off it, I'd like Oscar Meyer Weinermobile please.  That is the pimpmobile daddy-o!!!  anyways, i'm pretty cool with this crap, just let me know eh?

eat, sleep, drink, quake2.  oh, forget that sleep part.
